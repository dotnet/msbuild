# Branding

This folder contains images used for branding MSBuild in various places.  If you add a new image, please indicate where it is used.

## MSBuild-Icon.png ![MSBuild-NuGet-Icon.png](MSBuild-Icon.png?raw=true)
This image is the original graphic used for creating the MSBuild icon.  It was placed here from its original location but is not currently used by anything.

## MSBuild-Logo.png ![MSBuild-NuGet-Icon.png](MSBuild-Logo.png?raw=true)
This image is an original graphic created by Immo Landwerth.  It can be used for images where the size is required to be larger than the MSBuild-Icon.png.

## MSBuild-NuGet-Icon.png ![MSBuild-NuGet-Icon.png](MSBuild-NuGet-Icon.png?raw=true)
This image is used by the NuGet packages as the ``<iconUrl />``.  Its raw location in this repo is used by the forwarding link [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=825694](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=825694).  If it is moved, please update the link.

If the below image loads, then the forwarding link is working.
