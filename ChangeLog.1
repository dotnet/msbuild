	* default.c (default_variables): Rename 2nd LINK.s defn to LINK.S.

Fri Dec 14 15:05:25 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at albert.ai.mit.edu)

	* vpath.c (selective_vpath_search): Check for makefile-mentioned before
	checking for actual existence.  The old order loses if the containing
	directory doesn't exist (but a rule might make it).

	* make.h [__GNUC__]: Don't #define alloca if already #define'd.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Don't look at the target constructed for
	the empty rule when making the null-suffix rule.  Construct it over
	again, since the former may have been freed already.

Thu Dec 13 17:21:03 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* make.h [__GNU_LIBRARY__]: Include <unistd.h> to get random fn decls.

Wed Dec 12 17:12:59 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* make.h, arscan.c, glob.c: Only include <memory.h> #ifdef USG.

	* variable.c (define_variable_in_set): Replace env_overrides check that
	wasn't really redundant (undoing Sep 28 change).  Add comment saying
	why this check is necessary.

	* job.c, main.c [DGUX]: Needs siglist like USG.

Mon Dec 11 01:19:29 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at albert.ai.mit.edu)

	* default.c [M_XENIX]: For rules that are different for Xenix, use the
	generic Unix version #ifdef __GNUC__.

	* main.c [M_XENIX]: Use USGr3-style setvbuf call.

	* read.c (find_percent): Do backslash folding correctly, not leaving
	extra crud on the end of the string.

	* job.c: Don't declare wait3 if it's #defined.

	* GNUmakefile, compatMakefile, make.texinfo: Change make-info
	to make.info.

Thu Dec  7 21:20:01 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* make.h [STDC_HEADERS || __GNU_LIBRARY__ || _POSIX_SOURCE]: Use
	ANSI <string.h> and names for str/mem functions.
	Use <stdlib.h> to declare misc fns rather than explicit decls.
	[_POSIX_SOURCE]: Don't declare kill (<signal.h> will).
	Include <sys/types.h> before <signal.h> because some braindead
	nonconformant 1003.1 implementation needs it.
	* misc.c: Don't declare malloc, realloc.  Do it in make.h.
	* arscan.c, glob.c: Use sequence for string fns from make.h verbatim.
	* make.h (S_ISDIR, S_ISREG): Declare if necessary.
	* commands.c (delete_child_targets), job.c (search_path), read.c
	(construct_include_path): Use S_ISfoo(m) instead of
	(m & S_IFMT) == S_IFfoo.
	* dir.c, glob.c [_POSIX_SOURCE]: Use dirent.

Wed Nov 29 22:53:32 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

Tue Nov 28 16:00:04 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* arscan.c (ar_name_equal) [APOLLO]: Don't do `.o' hacking.  On Apollos
	the full file name is elsewhere, and there is no length restriction (or
	so I'm told).

Thu Nov 23 17:33:11 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at albert.ai.mit.edu)

	* load.c [hp300 && BSD] (LDAV_CVT): Define for this system.

	* GNUmakefile (make-*.tar.Z): Use `h' option to tar (dereference
	symlinks), to grab texinfo.tex from wherever it lives.

Tue Oct 30 16:15:20 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.58.13.

Fri Oct 26 14:33:34 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* GNUmakefile: make-*.tar.Z: Include texinfo.tex.

Tue Oct 23 19:34:33 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (define_makeflags): When there are no flags to write, make
	sure the array has two leading nulls, since `MAKEFLAGS' is defined from
	&flags[1].

	* main.c (default_keep_going_flag): New variable (constant one).
	(command_switches: -k, -S): Use above for default value.
	(define_makeflags): Only write flag/flag_off switches if they are on,
	and either there is no default value, or they are not the default.

Mon Oct 22 16:14:44 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* main.c (struct command_switch): New member `no_makefile'.
	(command_switches: -n, -q, -t): Set no_makefile == 1.
	(define_makeflags): Take new arg MAKEFILE: if nonzero, don't use
	options whose `no_makefile' flags are set.
	(main): Call define_makeflags with MAKEFILE==1 before remaking
	makefiles, and again with MAKEFILE==0 before remaking goals.

Tue Oct  2 17:16:45 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.58.12.

Mon Oct  1 15:43:23 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* arscan.c [HPUX]: Use PORTAR==1 format.

Sat Sep 29 16:38:05 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* make.h, remake.c, arscan.c: Don't declare `open'.

Fri Sep 28 04:46:23 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* variable.c (define_variable_in_set): Remove redundant -e check.

Wed Sep 26 00:28:59 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (start_job): Set RECURSIVE from the right elt of
	CHILD->file->cmds->lines_recurse.

	* commands.c (chop_commands): Don't botch the line count for allocating
	CMDS->lines_recurse.

	* Version 3.58.11.

	* job.c (start_job): Don't always increment CHILD->command_line!  Only
	do it when CHILD->command_ptr has run out!  (Dumb bug.  Sigh.)

Thu Sep 20 02:18:51 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* GNUmakefile [ARCH]: Give explicit rule for remote.{c,dep} to use
	variable `REMOTE' for more flags.
	($(prog)): Link in $(LOADLIBES).

Wed Sep 19 02:30:36 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* commands.h (struct commands): New member `ncommand_lines', the number
	of elts in `command_lines' et al.
	* commands.c (chop_commands): Set `ncommand_lines' elt of CMDS, and
	don't put a nil pointer at the end of `command_lines'.
	* job.h (struct child): New member `command_lines' to hold
	variable-expanded command lines.
	* job.c (new_job): Store expanded command lines in `command_lines'
	member of new child.  Don't clobber FILE->cmds.
	(start_job): Use CHILD->command_lines in place of
	CHILD->file->cmds->command_lines.

	* variable.h, variable.c, job.c, expand.c: Undo yesterday's change,
	which is no longer necessary since we have cleverly avoided the issue.

	* job.c (start_job): Don't variable-expand each command line.
	(new_job): Do them all here, storing the expansions in the array.

Tue Sep 18 01:23:13 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* variable.c (define_variable_in_set): Don't initialize it.
	* expand.c (struct variable_expanding): New type, a linked list
	containing `struct variable' pointers.
	(variables_expanding): New variable, the chain of variables currently
	being expanded.
	(recursively_expand): Don't test and set `expanding' member.
	Instead, run through the `variables_expanding' chain looking for a link
	referring to V to find self-reference.  Add a new link to the chain,
	describing V, before recursive expansion, and pop it off afterward.
	* job.c (child_handler): Save `variables_expanding' and clear it before
	calling start_job, and restore it afterward.  This avoids major lossage
	when the SIGCHLD comes in the middle of variable expansion.

Mon Sep 17 14:46:26 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c, commands.c: Don't define sigmask.
	* make.h: Put it here instead.

	* variable.c (target_environment): If `.NOEXPORT' was specified as a
	target, only export command-line and environment variables, and
	file-origin variables that were in the original environment.

	* make.man: Add missing ?roff control for `-I' option description.

Thu Sep 13 14:10:02 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* load.c [UMAX]: Move #include <sys/sysdefs.h> to [not UMAX_43].

Wed Sep 12 15:10:15 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* expand.c (recursively_expand): Don't use `reading_filename' and
	`reading_lineno_ptr' if they're nil.

Thu Aug 30 17:32:50 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech)

	* Version 3.58.10.

Tue Aug 28 04:06:29 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c [USG] (unknown_children_possible): New variable, set nonzero
	when it's possible for children not in the `children' chain to die.
	(block_signals) [USG]: Set it.
	(unblock_signals) [USG]: Clear it.
	(child_handler) [USG]: Don't complain about unknown children if
	`unknown_children_possible' is set.

	* read.c (do_define): Make sure there's enough space for the newline,
	so we don't write off the end of allocated space.

	* arscan.c (ar_name_equal): Fixed to work when MEM is AR_NAMELEN-1 but
	NAME is not the same length.

Sat Aug 25 16:17:14 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech)

	* job.c (construct_command_argv_internal): Use a static char array for
	a constant, since old C has no auto aggregate initializers.

Thu Aug 23 16:11:03 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (search_path): If PATH is nil or "" use a default path.

Wed Aug 22 01:05:32 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at churchy.ai.mit.edu)

	* Version 3.58.9.

	* job.c (exec_command): Don't take PATH and SHELL args.  Get them from
	ENVP.
	(child_execute_job): Don't take FILE arg, and don't pass path and shell
	to exec_command.
	(start_job): Don't pass FILE arg to child_execute_job.
	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Ditto.
	* main.c (main): Don't pass path and shell to exec_command.

Fri Aug 17 23:17:27 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech)

	* job.c (construct_command_argv_internal): New fn broken out of
	construct_command_argv.  Takes strings SHELL and IFS instead of doing
	variable expansion for them.  Recurse to make an argv for SHELL,
	passing SHELL==0.  When SHELL==0, don't recurse for shell argv; make a
	simple one using /bin/sh.
	(construct_command_argv): Do the variable expansions and call above.

Thu Aug 16 19:03:14 1990  Roland McGrath  (roland at geech)

	* read.c (multi_glob): For ~USER/FILE, if USER isn't found, don't
	change the file name at all.

Tue Aug  7 18:33:28 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* function.c (expand_function: `suffix'/`notdir'): Don't kill the last
	space if we never wrote one.

	* function.c (expand_function: `suffix'): Retain the dot, like the
	documentation says.

Mon Aug  6 14:35:06 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.58.8.

	* main.c (decode_switches): For positive_int and floating cases, move
	SW past the arg (and don't set it to ""), so another switch can follow.

Fri Aug  3 00:43:15 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* job.c (child_execute_job): Use unblock_signals instead of
	push_signals_blocked_p (0).

	* main.c (fatal_signal_mask): New variable, mask of signals caught with
	fatal_error_signal.
	(main): Set it.
	* job.c ({block,unblock}_children): Renamed to {block,unblock}_signals.
	Block/unblock both child signal and signals in fatal_signal_mask.
	(children_blocked_p_{stack,max,depth}, {push,pop}_children_blocked_p):
	Renamed from children to signals.  Use {block,unblock}_signals instead
	of {block,unblock}_children.
	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal), job.c (wait_for_children, new_job,
	child_execute_job, main, log_working_directory), function.c
	(expand_function: `shell'), job.h: Rename {push,pop}_children_blocked_p
	to {push,pop}_signals_blocked_p.
	* job.c (child_handler): Call {block,unblock}_signals instead of just
	{block,unblock}_remote_children.  We need to block the fatal signals.

Thu Aug  2 22:41:06 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* main.c, function.c: Fixed typos in comments.

	* file.c (print_file_data_base): Fix computation of avg files/bucket.

Wed Jul 25 16:32:38 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* arscan.c (ar_name_equal): Fixed to really do it right.
	(ar_member_pos): Fixed order of args.
	* ar.c (ar_member_date_1): Ditto.

Fri Jul 20 15:30:26 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* arscan.c (ar_name_equal): Rewritten.  Accounts for a possible
	trailing slash in MEM.

	* remake.c (f_mtime): Keep track of whether ARNAME is used and free it
	if not.  Also free MEMNAME.
	* ar.c (ar_member_date, ar_touch): Ditto.

	* arscan.c (arscan) [HPUX or hpux]: Treat same as USGr3 PORTAR==1.

	* make.h: If NSIG is not defined, but _NSIG is, #define NSIG _NSIG.

	* compatMakefile: Don't use $* in explicit rules.

	* default.c (default_variables: "PREPROCESS.S"): Include $(CPPFLAGS).

	* Version 3.58.6.

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): Fixed computation for ^F/?F elt len.

Sat Jul 14 13:41:24 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* job.c (construct_command_argv): Always use
	allocated_variable_expand_for_file instead of variable_expand_for_file
	because we might be called from inside a variable expansion (for the
	`shell' function).

	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Free the arglist's storage
	correctly.  construct_command_argv only allocates ARGV and ARGV[0].

	* job.c (children_blocked_p_idx): Renamed to children_blocked_p_depth.
	(push_children_blocked_p, pop_children_blocked_p): Use ..._depth
	instead of ..._idx, and do it right!

Wed Jul 11 15:35:43 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.h (SIGNAL): New macro to replace `signal' calls.  Does arg and
	ret value casts to (void *) #ifdef __STDC__ to avoid conflicts btwn
	ANSI and BSD `signal' and handler types.
	* main.c (main), job.c (child_handler): Use it.

Fri Jul  6 00:00:38 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* ar.c (ar_member_date, ar_touch): Pass 2nd arg to f_mtime.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Search the include path for MAKEFILES
	variable makefiles (TYPE == 1), like it says in the manual.

	* file.h (struct file), main.c (struct command_switch): Remove trailing
	commas from enums.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Remove unused variables.
	* commands.h: Declare chop_commands.
	* make.h: Declare uniquize_deps.
	* main.c (main): Remove unused variable.
	(decode_switches): Remove unused label.
	* remake.c: Include "ar.h" for ar_parse_name decl.

	* ar.c: Declare ar_name_equal.

	* GNUmakefile: If using gcc, add warning flags to CFLAGS.

	* remake.c: Remove decl of ar_member_date, since it's done in make.h.

	* remake.c (f_mtime): For ar refs, allow the archive to be found via
	VPATH search if we're searching, and change the ar ref accordingly.

	* ar.c (ar_parse_name): New global fn to parse archive-member
	references into the archive and member names.
	(ar_member_date, ar_touch): Use it.
	* make.h: Declare it.

	* remake.c (f_mtime): After doing rename_file, do check_renamed instead
	of assuming rename_file will always set FILE->renamed (which it won't).

	* vpath.c (selective_vpath_search): Only accept prospective files that
	don't actually exist yet are mentioned in a makefile if the file we are
	searching for isn't a target.

Wed Jul  4 04:11:55 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Do check_renamed after calling
	file_mtime.
	(check_dep): Ditto after update_file.

	* file.c (rename_file): Prettied up long message for merging cmds.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Get each dep file's modtime, and allow for
	it being renamed, before checking for a circular dep, since a renaming
	may have introduced one.

Tue Jul  3 18:15:01 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* ar.c (ar_touch): Don't free ARNAME since enter_file holds onto the
	storage.

	* function.c (string_glob): Don't leave a trailing space.

	* read.c (do_define): Allow leading whitespace before `endef'.

Mon Jul  2 14:10:16 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* implicit.c (pattern_search): No longer take NAME arg.  Instead take
	ARCHIVE flag.  If ARCHIVE is nonzero, FILE->name is of the form
	"LIB(MEMBER)"; rule for "(MEMBER)" is searched for, and LASTSLASH is
	set to nil.  Since NAME was only non-nil when it was the archive member
	name passed by try_implicit_rule, this change easily allows turning off
	LASTSLASH checking for archive members without excessive kludgery.
	(try_implicit_rule): Pass ARCHIVE flag instead of file name.

	* Version 3.58.5.

	* commands./c (set_file_variables): Don't kill last char of $(^D) elts.

Sat Jun 30 00:53:38 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* ar.c (ar_member_date): Don't free ARNAME since enter_file holds onto
	the storage.

	* arscan.c (ar_scan) [sun386 && PORTAR == 1]: Treat like USGr3.

Wed Jun 27 14:38:49 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* main.c (main): Put a newline on the debugging message when deciding
	not to remake a makefile to avoid a possible loop.
	Only decide not to remake makefiles that have commands (as well as
	being targets and having no deps).

Fri Jun 22 12:35:37 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* default.c (default_variables): Define `LINK.s' and `LINK.S'.
	(default_suffix_rules): Define .S.o rule.

	* job.c (construct_command_argv): If we decide to go the slow route,
	free all storage for the chopped args.
	(start_job): Free the argument list's storage correctly.
	construct_command_argv only allocates ARGV and ARGV[0].

Tue Jun 19 18:27:43 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.58.4.

Fri Jun 15 21:12:10 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* dir.c: Copied dirent vs direct et al mess from glob.c.

	* glob.c: Replaced with updated version from djm.
	* glob.c: Check macro DIRENT instead of _POSIX_SOURCE for <dirent.h>.
	__GNU_LIBRARY__ implies DIRENT and STDC_HEADERS.

Thu May 31 22:19:49 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* vpath.c (vpath_search): Don't stop the loop if a pattern matches but
	the search fails.  All matching patterns have their paths searched
	(like it says in the manual).

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Directory Search: Selective Search): Say that
	multiple `vpath' directives with the same pattern DO accumulate, not
	supersede earlier ones.

	* vpath.c (print_vpath_data_base): Increment the count of vpaths on
	each loop iteration, rather than letting it stay zero.

	* Version 3.58.3.

	* job.c (block_children, unblock_children): Made static.
	(push_children_blocked_p, pop_children_blocked_p): New functions to
	push and pop whether children are blocked or not.
	* job.h: Declare push_children_blocked_p, pop_children_blocked_p and
	not block_children, unblock_children.
	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal), job.c (wait_for_children, new_job,
	child_execute_job), main.c (main, log_working_directory): Use sequences
	of push_children_blocked_p (1) and pop_children_blocked_p () instead of
	explicitly blocking and unblocking children.
	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Don't unblock children.  The
	push-pop sequence in wait_for_children makes it unnecessary.

Tue May 29 21:30:00 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (do_define): Don't include the last newline in the definition.

	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Call construct_command_argv
	before forking and don't fork if it returns nil.  Free the argument
	list's storage before finishing.

	* job.c (start_job): Free the storage for the child's argument list
	in the parent side of the fork after the child has been spawned.

	* job.c (start_job): If construct_command_argv returns nil, go to the
	next command line.

	* job.c (construct_command_argv): Use the shell if the command contains
	an unterminated quote.

Wed May 23 19:54:10 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.58.2.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Parse "override define" correctly.

Thu May 17 15:25:58 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* arscan.c [USG]: Don't declare memcpy and memcmp.  <memory.h> should
	do this anyway (and lack of declarations is harmless).

	* remote-customs.c: Renamed to remote-cstms.c for System V.
	* remote.c [CUSTOMS]: Changed accordingly.

Sun May 13 14:38:39 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* GNUmakefile: Use same cmds for doc tar.Z as for dist tar.Z (so the
	contents go in make-N.NN).

Thu Apr 26 19:33:25 1990  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	function/var refs is unwise.  Clarify fn arg evaluation order.

	since some have defaults.
	(Implicit: Pattern Rules: Pattern Examples): Clarified use of $< and $@
	in first example.
	(Implicit: Last Resort): Don't say the .DEFAULT example creates files
	"silently".  It's automatic, but not silent.

	* make.texinfo (Name Index): Changed title to include directives.

	* Version 3.55.3 (alpha).

	* make.texinfo (Running: Options): Document -e.

	* main.c (main): Always give imported environment variables origin
	`o_env'.
	* variable.c (define_variable_in_set): Under -e, if ORIGIN, or an
	existing variable's origin, is `o_env', make it `o_env_override'.

	* load.c: Use the symbol KERNEL_FILE_NAME instead of KERNEL_FILE.
	* compatMakefile: Changed the comment for `LOAD_AVG' accordinly.

Thu Sep  7 16:46:26 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c, file.c, dir.c: Don't define *_BUCKETS if they are already
	defined.

	* compatMakefile (defines): Added comment about defining NO_ARCHIVES.
	(ARCHIVES, ARCHIVES_SRC): New variables for {ar,arscan}.[oc].
	(objs, srcs): Use $(ARCHIVES) and $(ARCHIVES_SRC).

	* load.c [LDAV_BASED] (load_average): Check for == -1, rather than < 0
	to see if lseek fails.  On some systems, `avenrun' is at an offset >
	(2**31)-1, and lseek succeeds, returning a negative value.

Mon Sep  4 11:07:58 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at saffron.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): Return `int' instead of `void': nonzero if
	the passed rule was used, zero if not.
	(install_pattern_rule): Pay attention to the return from
	new_pattern_rule, and don't set the rule's `terminal' flag or give it
	commands unless it's used.
	(create_pattern_rule): Same idea.

	* dir.c (find_directory): Removed unused variable.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Removed unused variable.

	* read.c (record_files): Don't use NAME after freeing it.

Sat Sep  2 00:33:19 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at saffron.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.55.1 (alpha).

	* function.c (string_glob): Don't add spaces after file names that
	aren't added.  (Also means don't add spaces without checking the size
	of the buffer.)

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Don't remove makefiles with cmds and no
	deps from the chain.
	* main.c (main): Do it here, before calling update_goal_chain.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): When updating fails, change STATUS even
	if MAKEFILES is set.  Also stop remaking when updating fails if not
	under -k and MAKEFILES is not set.

	* remake.c (remake_file, update_file_1, notice_finished_file),
	commands.c (execute_file_commands), make.h, commands.h: The functions
	remake_file, notice_finished_file, and execute_file_commands no longer
	return values, and their callers no longer expect values returned.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Don't set FILE's modtime to now if
	it is a non-target with no commands.

Fri Sep  1 00:04:39 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at saffron.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): After freeing each element on MAKEFILES,
	replace it with the name stored in read_makefiles by read_makefile.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Don't decide not to remake if FILE has no
	cmds and no deps actually changed if FILE doesn't have any deps.

	* file.c (remove_intermediate): Remove precious files that also have
	the `dontcare' flag set.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Don't always remake if FILE has cmds but no
	deps; only if FILE is double-colon.  (I don't know why this should be
	done for double-colon targets, but that's what Unix make does.)

	* load.c [LDAV_BASED] (load_average): Write error messages if the
	various system calls fail.  Keep track of if we've failed before.
	The first time we fail, write a message saying -l won't be enforced.
	The first time we succeed after having failed, write a message saying
	-l will be enforced again.

	* remake.c [USG]: Don't #include <sys/file.h>

	* load.c [generic Unix LDAV_BASED]: #include <fcntl.h> #ifdef USG,
	else <sys/file.h> instead.

	* job.c [USG && !USGr3 && !HAVE_DUP2]: Remove redundant
	#include <errno.h> and declaration of `errno'.
	[...] (dup2): Fixed so it won't always lose.

	* default.c (default_suffix_rules: .texinfo.dvi): Copy, rather than
	move, the aux and index files, so the TeX run can use them.

	* compatMakefile: Remove redundant comment.

	* load.c [generic Unix LDAV_BASED]: Include <a.out.h> instead of
	<nlist.h>, since the `struct nlist' declaration in <nlist.h> varies
	more than the one in <a.out.h>.
	(load_average): Use the `n_un.n_name' field of the `struct nlist',
	since the <a.out.h> declaration uses the union.

	* main.c (main): For the temporary files made for stdin makefiles, set
	the `intermediate' and `dontcare' flags.
	* file.c (remove_intermediates): Don't print any messages for files
	whose `dontcare' flag is set.  (The only files that will be
	intermediate and `dontcare' will be the temporary files made for stdin
	makefiles.)

	* job.c (exec_command): Made global.
	* job.h: Declare it.
	* main.c (main): Use exec_command when re-execing.

	* make.h: Declare environ.
	* make.c: Don't.

	* job.c (child_execute_job): New function to perform everything done in
	the child side of a fork (for a job or `shell' function).
	(start_job): Call it.
	* job.h: Declare construct_command_argv and child_execute_job.
	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Use child_execute_job.

Thu Aug 31 18:42:51 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at saffron.Berkeley.EDU)

	* function.c (expand_function: `shell'): Remove a trailing newline
	instead of turning it into a space.

	* ar.c (ar_name): Return zero for `(foo)'.

	* Version 3.55.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Multiple Targets): Make this node's `next'
	pointer point to `Static Pattern'.
	* make.texinfo (Makefiles: MAKEFILES Variable): Make this node's `prev'
	pointer point to `Makefile Names'.

	* make.1: Renamed to make.man.
	* compatMakefile: Define `mandir' and `manext'.
	(install): Depend on $(mandir)/make.$(manext).
	($(mandir)/make.$(manext)): Depend on make.man and copy it to $@.
	($(bindir)/make): Use `make' rather than $<; so Unix make can grok it.

Thu Aug 24 03:35:48 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* variable.c (target_environment): Allow variables that start with
	underscores.

Wed Aug 23 22:50:32 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* GNUmakefile (make-$(version).tar.Z): Put make.1 (the Unix manual
	page) in the tar file.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Don't write variables with origin
	o_default (i.e., ones from default.c).
	* make.texinfo (Commands: Recursion: Variables/Recursion): Document
	that default variables are not put in the environment.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Remake all targets with commands but no
	deps.

Sat Aug 19 06:03:16 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (update_file_1): In the final loop, set the deps'
	`changed' members if they are newer than FILE.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Under -d, print a message if we decide
	not to remake a makefile so as to avoid a possible infinite loop.

Fri Aug 18 20:30:14 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (remake_file): Cleaned up.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): If the commands are empty, set
	FILE->update_status to zero before returning.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Set `last_mtime' fields to zero
	instead of calling name_mtime; file_mtime will do that later if anybody
	cares.

Thu Aug 17 10:01:11 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Wildcards: Wildcard Examples): Give this node a
	`prev' pointer.

	* Version 3.54.9 (alpha).

	* make.texinfo: Fixed some @nodes.

	* remake.c (check_dep): Don't set *MUST_MAKE_PTR if FILE doesn't exist
	after running update_file.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): If FILE has no commands, pretend its
	modtime is now.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): In the loops that call update_file on the
	deps, compare modtimes before and after (unless deps are still being
	made) and set the deps' `changed' members.  Do not set the `changed'
	members in the loop that prints the newer/older debugging messages.
	* remake.c (update_file_1): If no deps changed and FILE has no
	commands, decide it doesn't need remaking.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Print a debugging message if we take
	commands from default_file.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Directory Search: Selective Search): Removed
	note about warning for `vpath' with a constant pathname, since it isn't
	warned about anymore.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): If MAKEFILES, remove makefiles which
	are targets and have no deps.
	* make.texinfo (Makefiles: Remaking Makefiles): Document that makefiles
	will not be remade if they are targets but have no dependencies.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Increment files_remade for non-phony
	files if they didn't exist before (even if they still don't).

	* job.c: Include <errno.h> and declare errno.

	* job.c (exec_command): If the execve fails with ENOEXEC (Exec format
	error), return instead of exiting the child process.

	* job.c (start_job): In the child side, if exec_command fails, try
	using the shell.

	* job.c (start_job): In the child side, call unblock_children instead
	of sigsetmask.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Under -n or -q, always increment
	files_remade for non-phony files.

	* rule.c (intall_pattern_rule): Use find_percent.

	* vpath.c (vpath_search): Pass the `percent' members to
	pattern_matches.

Mon Aug 14 23:30:24 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* vpath.c (struct vpath): New member `percent', to hold a pointer into
	the pattern where the % is.
	(construct_vpath_list): Call find_percent on the pattern and set the
	new `percent' member.
	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't run find_percent on `vpath' directive
	patterns.

	* function.c (pattern_matches): Take new arg PERCENT, a pointer into
	PATTERN where the % is.  If PERCENT is nil, copy PATTERN into local

	(expand_function: `filter', `filter-out'): Pass new arg to
	pattern_matches.
	* read.c (record_files): Pass PATTERN_PERCENT to pattern_matches for
	static pattern rules.  Save the percent pointer into implicit rule

	* README.templatate, README-doc.template: New files, turned into README
	and README-doc to go into the two distribution tar files.
	* GNUmakefile: Added a rule to edit the version number in
	README.template and README-doc.template, producing README and
	README-doc.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): If -n or -q is in effect for a
	makefile, and it got updated, don't change STATUS, so we can still
	return -1 (meaning nothing was done).  This avoids an infinite loop on
	"make -n Makefile".

Sat Aug 12 23:14:24 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Treat -q the same as -n.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Fixed handling of return from
	update_file.  If -n or -q is in effect, ignore it.

	* job.c (start_job): Don't test for -t.  We should never get called in
	that case.

	phony files.

	* job.c (child_handler): Don't set C->file->update_status to 1 if
	start_job returns nonzero under -n or -t.

	for a few months).

Tue Aug  8 23:53:43 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c (exec_command): Fixed to not ignore the last path component and
	to do the right thing with an empty path.

Fri Aug  4 15:58:19 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (library_file_mtime): Look for libLIB.a, not /libLIB.a.

Thu Aug  3 20:42:00 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c [HAVE_SYS_WAIT or not USG]: If WIFSIGNALED is not defined by

Tue Aug  1 19:25:34 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* remake.c (remake_file): If FILE has no commands and is a target,
	don't set its time to now.  The time gets reset by notice_finished_file
	anyway, and it isn't needed since check_dep checks for nonexistence.

	* Version 3.54.6.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't read off the end of the string after an
	`include'.

	* job.c (exec_command): New function to search the path for a file and
	execute it.
	(start_job): Use exec_command rather than execvp.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Expand `include' directive args before
	parsing them.  Allow trailing whitespace after filename.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Put makelevel + 1, rather than
	makelevel, in the `MAKELEVEL' envariable.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): Don't get the new modtime of phony
	files.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Run commands instead of touching under -t if
	FILE->cmds->any_recurse is set.

	* commands.h (struct commands): Add new member `any_recurse', to be set
	nonzero if any `lines_recurse' element is nonzero.
	* commands.c (chop_commands): Set the `any_recurse' member.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Split chopping of commands into
	lines into new function chop_commands.
	* commands.h: Declare chop_commands.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Test for a line beginning with a tab after

Fri Jul  7 12:11:30 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* job.c: If WTERMSIG is defined by <sys/wait.h>, define WAIT_T as int,
	and don't define other macros; this covers HP-UX.

Sun Jun 18 13:07:45 1989  Roland McGrath  (roland at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* GNUmakefile (depend): Split commands into two lines so they won't be
	so long when variable-expanded.

	* compatMakefile: Documented MINUS_C_MINUS_O meaning.  The line

Mon Jun 12 17:45:11 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (check_dep): Drop circular dependencies instead of fataling.
	(update_file_1 already does this.)

	* default.c (default_suffix_rules): For .s -> .o, put the -o flag to
	the assembler before the source file name.

Sun Jun 11 12:00:52 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	line, listing all files.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't free the storage for the passed
	filename, since it might not be malloc'd.  When doing an included
	makefile, free the name's storage.

	`MAKEFILES'.  Free the storage for the names of -f makefiles.
	(read_makefile): Allocate storage for the makefile name in the
	`struct file' in read_makefiles.

	* make.texinfo (Running: Instead of Execution): Document the effect of

	decode_env_switches, define_makeflags, die, print_version,
	print_data_base): Moved to new file main.c.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Don't collapse backslash-newlines
	here.  When chopping the commands up into lines, don't chop at

	and made global.

Sat Jun 10 00:11:25 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (library_file_mtime): Check for libNAME.a in the current
	directory before doing VPATH search.

	* variable.c (print_variable_set): Don't write "# Variables", and write
	fewer blank lines.
	(print_variable_data_base): Precede the variables with "# Variables".

	* make.c (main): Print the data base under -p after doing everything
	else, just before exitting.  This way it gets info determined in
	updating the goal targets.

	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Split into print_variable,
	which prints one variable, and print_variable_set, which prints a set.
	Replaced with a call to print_variable_set for the global set.
	(print_file_variables): New function to print a given file's local
	variables.

	* file.c (print_file_data_base): Call print_file_variables to print

	the $^ and $? variables!!!

	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Pattern Rules: Automatic): Document new D and
	F versions of $^ and $?.

	* commands.c (start_job): In the child fork, use getdtablesize and a
	loop to close all file descriptors other than 0, 1, and 2.  We need to
	do this since not only the bad stdin pipe, but also some directories,
	may be open.

	* commands.c (start_job): Use fork instead of vfork, because a vfork
	parent and child share file descriptors, and our child needs to diddle
	with stdin.

	* variable.c (initialize_file_variables): When created a new variable
	set, zero out the hash table.

	* variable.c (target_environment): Don't use variables whose names are
	not made up of alphanumerics and underscores.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set the `parent' member of each dependency
	to FILE before updating it.

	* file.h (struct file): Add `parent' member.

	* variable.c (initialize_file_variables): Don't take second arg PARENT.
	Use FILE->parent instead.  If FILE->parent->variables is nil, recurse
	to initialize it.

	* variable.h: Declare {allocated_}variable_expand_for_file.

	* variable.c (allocated_variable_expand): Now
	allocated_variable_expand_for_file, calling variable_expand_for_file,
	and taking second arg FILE.
	(allocated_variable_expand): New function, a wrapper around
	allocated_variable_expand_for_file, passing a nil second arg.

Fri Jun  9 12:11:45 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (start_job): On the child side of the fork, always close
	the bad stdin file descriptor.

	* commands.c (struct child): New member `environment', to hold the
	environment for the child.
	(execute_file_commands): Set the new childs `environment' member to nil
	before calling start_job.
	(start_job): Set up CHILD->environment before running the commands if
	it is nil.

	* make.c (main): Don't call new_environ.  `shell' functions will now be
	run with the environment make was called with.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Don't check C->command_ptr before calling
	start_job since we now have to check C->file->cmds->command_lines and
	it's easier to let start_job handle all that.

	* commands.c (struct child): New member `command_line', to hold an
	index into file->cmds->command_lines.
	(execute_file_commands): Set the new child's `command_line' to 0 and
	its `commands' and `commands_ptr' to nil.
	(start_job): When CHILD->command_ptr runs out, increment
	CHILD->command_line and run the corresponding line from
	CHILD->file->cmds->command_lines.  Run it even under -t, -q, or -n if
	the CHILD->file->cmds->lines_recurse element for that line is set.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Chop CMDS up into lines, setting
	its `command_lines' and `lines_recurse' members, if it wasn't already
	chopped.

	* commands.h (struct commands): New members `command_lines' and
	`lines_recurse'.  The first is an array of chopped-up lines; the second
	is an array of flags, each nonzero if the corresponding line is
	recursive.

	* variable.c (variable_expand_for_file): If FILE is nil, just do a
	vanilla variable_expand.
	(expand_function: `shell'): Pass second arg (as nil) to
	construct_command_argv.

	* commands.c (construct_command_argv): Use variable_expand_for_file on
	`$(SHELL)' and `$(IFS)' instead of lookup_variable to check those
	variables.  This handles file-local and recursive values correctly.
	To support this, take an additional argument FILE.

	* variable.c (initialize_file_variables): New function to initialize
	FILE's variable set list from PARENT's setlist.  PARENT is the
	immediate dependent that caused FILE to be remade, or nil if FILE is a
	goal.  (When user-level per-file variables are implemented, PARENT
	should be passed as nil when defining per-file variables.)

	* variable.c (variable_expand_for_file): New function to expand a line
	using the variable set of a given file, and reporting error messages
	for the file and line number of that file's commands.

	* variable.h: Don't declare lookup_variable_for_file.

	* variable.c (lookup_variable_*): Turned back into lookup_variable.  It
	now uses current_setlist.
	(global_setlist): New static `struct variable_set_list', a setlist
	containing global_variable_set.
	(current_setlist): New static `struct variable_set_list *', a pointer
	to the current variable set list.
	(define_variable): Define in the current top-level set, not the global
	set.

	* commands.c (set_file_variables): New function to set up the automatic
	variables for a file in its own variable set.
	(execute_file_commands): Use set_file_variables.

	* variable.c (new_environ): Replaced with target_environment, taking an
	argument FILE, and returning an environment for FILE's commands.

	* variable.c, variable.h: Remove all global special variable pointers.

	* variable.c (define_variable_for_file): New function like
	define_variable, but takes additional arg FILE, and defines the
	variable in the variable set at the top of FILE's chain.
	(lookup_variable_for_file): New function like lookup_variable, but
	takes additional arg FILE, and looks the variable up in all of FILE's
	variable sets.

	* file.h (struct file): New member `variables', a `struct
	variable_set_list' containing the list of variable sets used in the
	expansion of the file's commands.

	* variable.c (variables): Replaced with static `struct variable_set'
	global_variable_set.
	(define_variable): Now define_variable_in_set, taking additional
	argument SET, the `struct variable_set' to define it in.
	(define_variable): Use define_variable_in_set with global_variable_set.
	(lookup_variable): Now lookup_variable_in_set, taking additional
	argument SET, the `struct variable_set' to look it up in.
	(lookup_variable): Use lookup_variable_in_set with global_variable_set.
	(lookup_variable_in_setlist): New function to look up a variable in a
	`struct variable_set_list' using lookup_variable_in_set.

	* variable.h (struct variable_set): New structure, containing a hash
	table and the number of hash buckets.
	(struct variable_set_list): New structure, containing a link for a
	linked-list, and a `struct variable_set'.

	* commands.c (start_job): Under -n, return what the recursive start_job
	call returns, since it might actually start a child.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Wildcards): Document ~ and ~USER expansion.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): If start_job returns
	failure, but -t is set, set FILE->update_status to success.
	(start_job): If -t is set, and the commands are not recursive, return
	failure (is is done for -q).

	* remake.c (touch_file): New function to touch FILE.
	(remake_file): Use touch_file.  When touching a file, still do
	execute_file_commands.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Don't check question_flag (-q), since we
	can't know here if the commands are recursive.

	* commands.c (start_job): Don't use the `recursive' member of
	CHILD->file->cmds.  Instead, check for leading +s and $(MAKE) or
	${MAKE} in the command line here.

	* commands.h (struct commands): Remove `recursive' member.

	* rule.c (install_default_pattern_rules): Remove use of `recursive'
	member.

	* read.c (record_files): Don't check commands from $(MAKE) and set
	their `recursive' member.

	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal): Treat SIGQUIT like SIGINT, SIGHUP,
	and SIGTERM, but don't send it to ourselves because it will cause a
	core dump.

Thu Jun  8 20:30:04 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.50.

	* variable.c (variable_expand): Use allocated_variable_expand instead
	of expand_argument in a few places.

	* variable.c (allocated_variable_expand): Do static variable shuffling
	here instead of using expand_argument.
	(expand_argument): Use allocated_variable_expand.

	* variable.c (recursively_expand): New function to recursively expand
	its argument (a `struct variable'), returning the malloc'd value.
	(variable_expand): Use recursively_expand.

Sun May 28 12:49:27 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (main): Fixed buggy fix in deciding to increase space for
	command-line variable definitions.  (First it never did it, then it
	always did it; now it does it when necessary.)

Sat May 27 14:01:54 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at hecuba.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (main): Fixed bug in deciding to increase space for
	command-line variable definitions.

Fri May 26 15:48:01 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (multi_glob): Use allocated_expand_variable for checking
	`HOME' variable for ~ expansion, since this may be called from inside a
	`wildcard' function expansion.

	* variable.h: Declare allocated_expand_variable.

	* variable.c (allocated_expand_variable): New function to do variable
	expansion in an allocated buffer, rather than the static one.

	* make.c (main): Don't set glob_tilde (it no longer exists).

	* variable.c (string_glob): Use multi_glob and parse_file_seq.

	* read.c (multi_glob): Do ~ expansion here.

	* glob.c (glob_tilde, glob_filename): Removed ~ expansion.

	* variable.c (define_variable, lookup_variable): Use a smarter hashing
	algorithm (the same one used for files and directories).
	(VARIABLE_BUCKETS): Increased to 523.

	* file.c (enter_file, lookup_file, rename_file): Use a smarter hashing
	algorithm, spreading the bits about somewhat.

	* make.c (log_working_directory): Under `-p', precede the directory
	message with a `#'.

	* make.c (print_version): Under `-p', precede each line with a `#'.
	(print_data_base): Precede the header line with a `#' and include the
	date and time on it.

	* vpath.c (print_vpath_data_base): Precede non-directive
	lines with `#'s.

	* commands.c (print_commands): Precede the non-command line with a `#'.

	* rule.c (print_rule_data_base), file.c (print_file_data_base): Precede
	non-rule lines with `#'s.

	* dir.c (print_dir_data_base): Precede all lines with `#'s.

	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Changed format so that it can
	be makefile input.  Lines that are not variable definitions are
	preceded with `#'.  Nonrecursive variable definitions are made with all
	dollar signs doubled to reproduce the initial value.  Recursive
	variable definitions containing newlines are done with `define'
	directives.  Nonrecursive variable definitions containing newlines, and
	variable names containing :, =, or newlines, will come out garbled.

Wed May 24 00:20:04 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.49.

	find_percent instead of pattern_p.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `patsubst'): Pass new args (both nil)
	to patsubst_expand.
	(variable_expand): For $(var:pat%=rep%) references, pass new args to
	patsubst_expand so as to avoid find_percent and thus disallow
	quoting the %s.

	* read.c (record_files): Pass new args to patsubst_expand.

	* variable.c (patsubst_expand): Take two new args: PATTERN_PERCENT
	and REPLACE_PERCENT.  Each of these, if non-nil, means that PATTERN
	(or REPLACE) has already been run through find_percent, and
	PATTERN_PERCENT (or REPLACE_PERCENT) is the result.

	* make.h: Declare find_percent instead of pattern_p.

	* read.c (pattern_p): Changed to find_percent, returning a pointer
	to the %, or nil if there is none.
	(record_files): Take another arg, PATTERN_PERCENT, a pointer to the
	% in PATTERN.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Static Pattern: Static Usage,
	Rules: Directory Search: Selective Search,
	Functions: Text Functions): Documented that `%' can be quoted.

	* read.c (pattern_p): Made global.
	* make.h: Declare pattern_p.

	* read.c (pattern_p): New function to search for an unquoted % in a
	string.  Backslashes quote %s and backslashes.  Quoting backslashes
	are removed from the string by compacting it into itself.  Returns
	nonzero if an unquoted % was found, zero if not.
	(record_files): Use pattern_p to check for implicit rules.
	(read_makefile): Use pattern_p to check for static pattern rules.
	Also use it to allow quoted %s in `vpath' patterns; warn about
	`vpath' patterns with no %s.

Mon May 22 16:31:52 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* glob.c (glob_filename): Replace a `1' with the `l' that should
	have been there.  This incidentally stops it from dumping core.

	* glob.c (glob_filename): If the path is just a directory, with no
	file name pattern, return the directory alone.

	* glob.c (glob_tilde): New global variable (int), defaults to zero.
	(glob_filename): If glob_tilde is nonzero, expand ~ or ~USER.

	* variable.c (string_glob): Keep a static allocated buffer for file
	names taken from the list, instead of allocating and freeing one
	every time.

	changes to allow for strange compiler syntax.

	* rule.c (default_variables): Don't include "> $@" in
	$(PREPROCESS.S), since it's already in the .S.s rule.

	* file.c (enter_file): Make a new double-colon file the `prev'
	member of the bottom `prev' file (the one whose `prev' is nil).

	* read.c (do_define): Append newlines after copying the lines into
	the value buffer, so we end up with a trailing newline.

	`remote_description' is not nil or "", append "-%s" (its value) to
	the version number.
	* remote-*.c: Define remote_description appropriately.

Sun May  7 15:15:53 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (error_status): Converted to new function child_error,
	taking new arguments TARGET_NAME and IGNORED, and writing an error
	message: "*** [target] Error 1" (or signal #, etc.), appending
	" (ignored)" if IGNORED is nonzero.
	(child_handler): Use child_error instead of error_status.

	* compatMakefile (all): Don't depend on `doc'.

	* compatMakefile (clean): Don't remove make-info*.
	(realclean): New rule, depends on `clean', removes tags, TAGS,
	and all Info and TeX files.

	* make.c (print_data_base): Call print_vpath_data_base.

	* file.c (print_file_data_base): Changed format to look more like a
	makefile rule.  Now reports all information in the `struct file'.

	* rule.c (print_rule_data_base): Changed format of display from:
	  %: (terminal)
	   depends on: RCS/%,v
	to:
	  %: RCS/%,v
	    is terminal.
	    references nonexistent subdirectory.
	Also include number and percent that refer to nonexistent

	* make.c (main): Figure out the level of recursion before writing
	the `Entering directory' message.

	Do handle SIGDANGER if it is defined.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Reorganized inner loop so that it
	doesn't try to inspect the child before finding it.

Tue Apr 25 16:28:24 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (end_of_token): Fixed bug wherein backslashes caused
	immediate return.

	* Version 3.47.

	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Pattern Rules: Automatic): Document
	setting of `$*' for explicit rules.  Add note clarifying that
	automatic variables, though referred to in the documentation as

Mon Apr 10 19:31:34 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Put rules with `subdir' flags set in
	TRYRULES, since these might be valid with VPATHs.  In the TRYRULES
	loop, don't do lookup_file or file_exists_p calls for dependencies
	of rules with `subdir' flags set, but still do vpath_search calls
	and intermediate-file searches.

Wed Apr  5 15:24:48 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* file.c (remove_intermediates): Don't use `file_exists_p' to check
	for the existence of intermediate files, because the hashed
	directories will probably be out of date.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Free the good stdin before running the
	next command line.

	* commands.c [USG] (init_siglist): Don't case SIGEMT if it's not
	defined.  Do case SIGDANGER (for IBM RT) if it is defined.

	* commands.c: Changed `SYS_WAIT' to `HAVE_SYS_WAIT'.
	(child_handler): Use `wait3' if HAVE_SYS_WAIT is #defined.

	* file.c (enter_file): If any `./'s are stripped off, allocate a new
	copy of the shortened name.

	* Version 3.45.

	* GNUmakefile: Make a separate tarfile of the DVI and info files.

	* dir.c (struct directory): Remove `modtime' member.
	(find_directory): Don't set `modtime' member.
	(check_changed_directories): Removed this function.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set FILE->command_state to cs_finished
	if it didn't need to be remade.

	* remake.c (update_file): Only write the "up to date" message if the
	target went from `not_started' state to `finished' state without
	incrementing the count of files remade.

	* commands.c [USG] (init_siglist): If both SIGCHLD and SIGCLD are
	defined, don't put them both in the `switch'.

Tue Mar 28 15:37:02 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* file.c (rename_file): Change FILE's name!!!

	exists, and it is a target or has deps or commands, barf.
	If not just remove the old one for put in the new one.

	* remake.c (update_file_1, check_dep): Changed it back so that equal
	modtimes to NOT make dependencies be considered newer.  RCS checks
	out files with equal modtimes as the RCS files, so this screws it.

	* make.h, glob.c: If __GNUC__ is defined, use __builtin_alloca.

	* Makefile: Use variables `ALLOCA' and `ALLOCASRC' so systems
	without a good standard alloca can get it from the Emacs
	distribution (or somewhere).

	* dir.c: Don't include <sys/stat.h>, since make.h does.

	* make.c: Removed debugging version of getwd.

	* Version 3.42.

	* rule.c (default_variables): Set F77 to $(FC) and F77FLAGS to
	$(FFLAGS) so explicit rules expecting these (which are in System V)
	will work.  However, there is no way to make setting these affect
	the implicit rules, unless we trash FC and FFLAGS (which BSD uses).
	[USG]: Set GET to `get' rather than `/usr/sccs/get'.

Sun Mar 19 20:00:27 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.texinfo: Cleaned-up edition 0.1 Beta from RMS and Bob Chassell.

	* file.c (rename_file): If a file with the new name already existed,
	use the same storage space, after freeing the old file's name, deps,
	and `also_make' member, preserving the link in the chain.
	Also write an error message telling the user to report the incident;
	I don't think this should be able to happen, but I'm not sure.

	* file.c (rename_file): Don't add the hash values of the old and new
	names together!  Reset HASHVAL before computing the second value.

	* dir.c (check_changed_directories): Zero the new file hash table

	directory exists.

	* vpath.c (check_changed_vpaths): New function to run through the
	search paths of all VPATHs, making the `exists' members correspond
	to reality.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Call check_changed_vpaths.

	* make.h: Declare check_changed_vpaths.

	* vpath.c (struct vpath): New element `exists', an array of char

	returning.
	make.h: Declare check_changed_directories.

Tue Mar 14 20:07:13 1989  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.40.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Don't set *MAKEFILES to the name of
	the end of the read_makefiles chain, since the latter may be from an
	included makefile.  (Why did I do this before?)

	* make.c (main): Set argv[0] to "" if it was nil.  Don't put the
	command-line variable definitions into argv[0], only into the MAKE

	remote.c: Just include remote-stub.c

	* commands.c (child_handler): If we were called as a signal handler,
	return after handling one child.

	* commands.c [not USG]: Include <signal.h> and define `sigmask' if
	<signal.h> doesn't.
	(block_children, unblock_children): Use sigmask rather than
	bitshifting explicitly (and incorrectly).

	* remote.c (remote_kill): New function to send a signal to a
	remote child.

	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal): If we get a SIGTERM, send one to

	(start_job): Initialize `deleted' member to 0.
	(delete_child_targets): New function to delete a given child's

	* Version 3.35.

	* read.c (readline): Put a null in the beginning of the buffer

	completes, set `shell_function_completed' to 1 if it actually ran,
	or -1 if it didn't (due to fork or exec failure).

	* commands.c (block_children, unblock_children): New functions to
	block and unblock the child termination signal.

	* make.c (struct stringlist, main, decode_switches): Changed `index'
	member to `idx'.

Sat Dec 24 16:02:32 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (wait_for_children [USG]): Handle SIGCLD with SIG_DFL,

	under #ifdef LDAV_BASED.  Only loop while we have jobs running.
	Sleep for increasing amounts (increase one second per iteration)

	Handle floating-point (double) args.
	(command_switches): Added `-l' switch to set `max_load_average'.

	* load.c (load_average): New file and function to return a double
	that is the current load average (1.00 scale).
	* GNUmakefile, oldMakefile: Pass flags in $(LOAD_AVG) for load.c.

Thu Dec 15 15:22:08 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Makefile: Renamed to oldMakefile.
	* GNUmakefile: Make Makefile from oldMakefile and depend.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): When putting the default makefiles in
	the read_makefiles chain so they will be remade, put them in the
	right order.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): If MAKEFILES is nonzero, always make
	in serial, and return as soon as one goal whose `changed' member is
	nonzero  is successfully remade.

	* commands.c: Don't include <sys/fcntl.h>.

	* commands.c (construct_command_argv): Added ` to sh_chars.

	* make.h: Don't declare construct_makeflags.

	* make.c (main): Set up MAKEFLAGS and MFLAGS and make an environment
	both before and after reading the makefiles, so the makefiles can
	use them and possible change them, and later children will get the
	right information.
	(construct_makeflags): Replaced with define_makeflags (static void),
	which defines the two variables.
	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Don't define MAKEFLAGS
	and MFLAGS.

Mon Dec 12 14:40:31 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.27.

	* commands.c (child_handler): Reset the handler to ourselves when
	called for USG, since it has no safe signals.

	* commands.c: For USG, use an int rather than a `union wait' for
	wait calls, and dissect it with bitmasks.
	(child_handler): No wait3 system call in USG.  Since we can't
	protect from hanging, always return immediately if we have no
	children we know about and we're not running a `shell' function.
	(There is still the danger of hanging waiting for a child that died
	without our being notified.)

	* remake.c: Include <fcntl.h> instead of <sys/file.h>.  What we need
	is really in <fcntl.h>, and while BSD <sys/file.h> includes
	<fcntl.h>, USG doesn't.

	* make.c (main): Figure out the program name before doing anything
	which might need it (in a call to error or fatal).

	* dir.c, glob.c: Use `struct dirent' and <dirent.h> for USGr3.

	* arscan.c (ar_scan): Added missing & before buf (which is an int)
	if SARMAG is not defined (SysV).

Fri Dec  9 18:44:13 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at pepper.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.26.

	* dir.c (find_directory, dir_file_exists_p): Keep track of how many
	directories we have open and don't let it be more than
	MAX_OPEN_DIRECTORIES (currently 10).

	* variable.c (expand_function: `foreach'): Use expand_argument
	rather than variable_expand so each repetition doesn't clobber the
	last!!!

Mon Dec  5 15:58:46 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at hecuba.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.25.

	* Makefile: Define `install' target.

	* GNUmakefile: Don't include GNUmakefile or depend in the
	distribution file.

Wed Nov 30 15:53:42 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Don't clobber a null into
	random storage if there were no $^ and/or $? words.

	* remake.c (check_dep): Set *MUST_MAKE_PTR nonzero if a dependency
	doesn't exist.

	* ar.c (ar_member_date, ar_touch): Make sure the modtime of the
	archive file itself is known before we fetch or change the modtime
	of one of its members.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Expand variable and function references
	before parsing rules so variable can contain special characters
	(colons and semicolons).

Sat Nov 26 11:36:31 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (expand_function: `filter', `filter-out'): Fixed so
	that filter-out works right.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `filter', `filter-out'): Made these
	functions use each word of their first argument as a pattern.

Fri Nov 25 10:51:47 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.24.

	* read.c (record_files): If a target is listed more than once in a
	single rule (that defines commands), give a warning message rather
	than the counter-intuitive message saying commands were already
	defined (in the same place).

	* make.c (fatal, error): Made them both take 6 args since there is
	at least one error message that need that many.  Too bad vfprintf is
	not universal!

	* Version 3.23.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Moved the construction of the `struct
	commands' into record_files.  Call record_files before recursing for an
	included makefile so the higher-up will determine the default goal.
	(record_files): Take arguments COMMANDS, COMMANDS_IDX and
	COMMANDS_STARTED and construct a `struct commands.

Thu Nov 24 14:36:33 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at paris.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.22.

	* make.c (main): Made it a fatal error if we can't move back to the
	directory we started in before re-execing.

	* make.c (main): Get the current directory before doing anything
	else, so we know it even if we don't need it for the value of
	`MAKE', since we might want it when re-execing.

Wed Nov 23 13:34:44 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.21.

	* read.c (record_files): Eliminate duplicate deps in a chain.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `sort'): Pass the right number to
	qsort, not one less.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Always call notice_finished_file if
	FILE->command_state == cs_finished.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Call notice_finished_file to
	set FILE's status correctly when start_job fails (because it's out
	of commands or running under -n).

Fri Nov 18 15:31:12 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at saffron.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.20.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set the `update_status' of FILE to
	nonzero and set FILE's `updated' bit if we have decided to give up
	on remaking FILE because of errors in the dependencies.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Debugging messages use `dependency' (vs.
	`dependent') properly.

	* make.texinfo (Conditionals: Conditional Syntax): Function index
	entries for `ifndef' and `ifneq'.

	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Define `MAKELEVEL' to the
	decimal number of the makelevel, since it may be malformed or blank.

	shorter.

Thu Nov 10 16:51:36 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at basil.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.18.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Made it eat leading spaces and formfeeds
	(but not tabs), like it's documented to.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Let included makefiles determine the
	default goal, as is done by System V Make.

Tue Nov  1 19:03:08 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (new_environ): Don't increment VCNT when a variable is
	rejected.

Fri Oct 28 16:54:15 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at basil.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.17.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Don't use the same storage for a name
	in two rules since new_pattern_rule may free this storage when a
	rule is discarded.

	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): Undid useless change I made Oct 25.

Thu Oct 27 19:17:53 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* GNUmakefile, Makefile: Fixed a typo in a comment.
	* Makefile: Removed malloc.o from object file list.

	* variable.c: Removed old debugging #define's for xmalloc and

	* make.c (main): Made local array for temp file name static so
	compilers that don't do auto aggregate initialization won't barf.

	* read.c: Removed static declaration of copy_dep_chain since it is
	no longer static.

Tue Oct 25 16:59:30 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at pepper.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): If we threw out the new rule because it
	matched an old one and OVERRIDE was zero, don't put the freed
	pointer in the chain!

Wed Oct 19 15:07:43 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at pepper.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.15.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `sort'): Don't do the sorting and
	writing out if there were no words in the first place.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Only fail with a "no way to make" message
	for a dependency (non-target) file.  If we don't know how to remake
	a target file, pretend it was successfully remade and is very new.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Don't increment `files_remade' for a
	non-target file we don't know how to remake.

	* read.c (record_files): Don't die with "both : and :: entries" for
	a file whose `is_target' flag is not set.

	second argument correctly.

	* ar.c (ar_touch): Return 1 rather than -1 for on errors.

Sat Oct 15 15:12:16 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.14.

	* GNUmakefile: Removed explicit rule for make.dvi since the built-in
	implicit rule now works.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Fixed .texinfo.dvi rule yet again
	so that it really works, now that parens are counted.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set FILE's `updated' flag after calling
	remake_file if it failed or finished immediately.

	* remake.c (update_file): Use the `updated' flag rather than the
	command state to decide if a file was fully considered, and
	therefore might give an "up to date" message.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made all functions that take more
	than one argument count parens of the appropriate flavor in their
	args and ignore commands nested in parens.

Fri Oct 14 18:35:00 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Pass second arg to read_makefile for
	default makefiles.

	* GNUmakefile: Added an explicit rule for make.dvi since the
	built-in .texinfo.dvi implicit rule is screwed up.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Added a comment that the
	.texinfo.dvi rule does not work because of an ahem, feature of Make
	that at some point will be fixed--er, enhanced to alleviate this
	difficulty.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Fixed Texinfo -> DVI rule (again).

	* make.texinfo (Commands: Execution): Documented new competing for
	standard input among children.

	* commands.c (struct child): Added `good_stdin' flag to tell if this
	child has the stdin that doesn't point into nirvana.
	(good_stdin_used): New variable to tell if any child has the good
	standard input.
	(child_handler): Reset `good_stdin_used' if a dead child's
	`good_stdin' flag is set.
	(start_job): Give the new child the good standard input if
	`good_stdin_used' is no set, and set the child's `good_stdin' flag
	appropriately.

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Changed Texinfo -> DVI rule to work
	better (I hope).

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Stop reading default makefiles after
	one is found.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Reset `reading_filename' and
	`reading_lineno_ptr' after recursing for an included makefile.

	* GNUmakefile: New GNU Make-specific makefile that does everything
	Makefile does plus distribution stuff, and doesn't contain any hacks
	to try to work with Unix make.

	* Makefile: Removed distribution stuff.

	* make.c (main): Use mktemp to construct the names of temporary
	files used for standard input makefiles.

	* make.c (main): Don't turn standard input into a broken pipe.

	* commands.c (start_job): Keep two extra file descriptors around: a
	good standard input, and a bad one that reads from a broken pipe.
	On the child side of the fork, if there are other children, give
	this one the broken pipe so they won't compete; if this is the only
	one, give it the good standard input.

	* make.h: Declare notice_finished_file.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Use noticed_finished_file
	after waiting for the child when there is only one job slot.

	* remake.c (notice_finished_file): New function to re-check mtime's
	and such things to be done when commands finish.
	(update_file_1): Use notice_finished_file.

	* commands.c (child_handler, execute_file_commands): Use new
	variable `job_slots_used' to record the number of jobs currently
	running, rather than diddling with `job_slots'.
	(execute_file_commands): Increment `job_slots_used' before calling
	start_job and decrement it on failure to avoid race condition.
	If there is only one job slot, wait for the child to finish and
	return its status so commands are run in linear order, as if there
	were no parallelism.

Wed Oct 12 15:59:03 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (remake_file): Don't print a "No way to make" message for
	targets whose `dontcare' flags are set.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Set the `dontcare' flag of the
	`struct file' each default makefile added to the chain.

	* file.h (struct file): Add `dontcare' member.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): When no default makefiles are found,
	put the names of all those tried in the `read_makefiles' chain so
	they will be updated if possible, giving their `struct dep's'
	`changed' members the value of 0 so we won't care if they cannot be
	found or remade.

	* make.texinfo (Makefiles: Remaking Makefiles): Documented that
	default makefiles will be remade if not found.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): If no default makefiles can be found,
	go through the list of default names, trying to make one, stopping
	if one is made.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Set STATUS to 0 after successfully touching.

	* dir.c (file_impossible, file_impossible_p): Don't clobber FILENAME
	to "" and then try to to a strcmp on it!!!

	* make.c (main): Don't do `dir_load (".")'.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits), vpath.c
	(construct_vpath_list): Test the existence of a given directory by
	`dir_file_exists_p (DIR, ".")' and assume that if this returns zero,
	it means the directory really does not exist.

	* dir.c (struct dirdata): Replaced with `struct directory' for
	directories, each containing a chain of `struct dirfiles', one for
	each file (real or impossible).
	(dir_load): Removed.
	(find_directory): New function to find the `struct directory' for a
	named directory and return it (possibly creating a new one).
	(dir_file_exists_p): Read the directory on the fly if its stream is
	still valid (and ever was) if the file we're looking for is not
	already in the hash tables.

	Use the new directory/file scheme.

	* make.texinfo: Miscellaneous editorial changes and clarifiactions.

	* commands.c (struct child): Remove `environ' member.

	* make.c (main): Call new_environ after reading makefiles.

	* variable.h: Declare `new_environ' to return void.

	* variable.c (new_environ): Put the environment in `environ' and
	return void.

	* Makefile: Don't make the uncompressed tar file.

	* variable.c (expand_function: `shell' function): Made it not expect

	* remake.c (update_file_1): A double-colon target with no deps
	always needs to be remade.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Changed "No way to make" message to say
	`target' rather than `file'.

Sun Oct  2 12:50:47 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at catnip.Berkeley.EDU)

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set FILE->update_status to the return
	value of remake_file.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Fixed swapped lengths passed to
	xmalloc for source/target suffixes.

	* make.texinfo: Documented that MAKEFLAGS and MFLAGS are read in
	from makefiles.  Updated the `Features' section a bit.

	* make.c (main): Read switches from MAKEFLAGS and MFLAGS variables
	after reading in makefiles.

	* make.c (main): Put a line "/tmp/foo:;" rather than ".PHONY:
	/tmp/foo" in front of temp files made for stdin makefiles.

	* remake.c (update_file): Test the state of the right `struct file'
	for double-colon files.

	* make.c (main): Put a ".PHONY: /tmp/foo" line in front of temp

	re-exec.  Kludge-o-matic!!

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Judge files as being finished based
	on their `updated' flag, not their state.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't check for FILENAME being "-".
	(read_all_makefiles): Set each element of MAKEFILES to the name put
	in READ_MAKEFILES by read_makefile, since read_makefile may free the
	storage for the name it is passed, and someone might want to look at
	the elements of MAKEFILES again.

	* make.c (main): For each `-f' flag with arg `-' (standard input),
	read standard input into a temp file and pass the temp file's name
	to read_all_makefiles, after making sure it will not be remade.

	makefiles if it's "-" (standard input).

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Set STATUS correctly when nothing

	DIRNAME and filename "" if DIRNAME doesn't exist.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Return 0 after start_job

	* remake.c (remake_file): Set the state to `cs_finished' when not
	calling execute_file_commands.

	meaning to disable -t, -q, and -n for each target unless the target
	was also given on the command-line.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Enter the `struct file's for the makefiles
	added to the `read_makefiles' `struct dep' chain.

	* remake.c (update_goal_chain): Made it not enter the files for the
	goals in the chain.  It will already have been done.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Null-terminate the names of targets
	and deps of the pattern rules properly.

Fri Sep 30 18:56:20 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at nutmeg.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.h: Declare copy_dep_chain.

	* read.c (copy_dep_chain): Moved to make.c (and made global).

	Update read makefiles and re-exec self if they change.

	* remake.c (update_file): Make this function static.
	(update_goal_chain): New function to update a `struct dep' chain of
	goals, waiting until they are all finished before returning.

	* read.c (find_makefile): Removed this function.
	(read_all_makefiles): Don't update makefiles, don't diddle with
	pattern rules, don't call snap_deps, etc.  Return a `struct dep'
	chain of all makefiles read.
	(read_makefile): Now takes two args: FILENAME and TYPE, which is 0
	for a normal makefile, 1 for MAKEFILES variable or 2 for an included
	makefile.  Add a `struct dep' containing the name of the makefile
	(as it was found in the search path for type 2s), and TYPE in the
	`changed' member to the global `read_makefiles' chain.

	* make.h, rule.c (displace_pattern_rules,
	add_displaced_pattern_rules): Removed these functions.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Variable-expand the name of an `include'd
	makefile before calling find_makefile on it.

	* file.c (snap_deps): If the `struct file' for a `struct dep'
	already exists, free the `struct dep's `name' member before setting
	it to nil (since this info is in the `struct file').

	* read.c (copy_dep_chain): Made it copy each name rather than
	leaving multiple `struct dep's with the same pointers.

Thu Sep 29 19:08:13 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at catnip.Berkeley.EDU)

	use correct length of "MFLAGS" (6, not 5).

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't stop reading when readline returns
	zero lines read.  Only stop when the stream reaches EOF.  This makes
	it recognize the last line of a makefile without a newline.

	* remake.c (remake_file): If we don't know how to make FILE, set its
	command state to `cs_finished'.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't write the "up to date" message if
	update_file_1 returned a nonzero status.

Wed Sep 28 16:30:07 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at catnip.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (child_handler): Set the `update_status' member

	* Version 3.09.

	* commands.c (struct child): New member `command_ptr' to hold the
	current position in the commands.  The `commands' member is never

	elements of its `environ' array and its `environ' member itself.
	(start_job): Set `environ' to the child's `environ' member before
	exec'ing the command.

	* variable.h, variable.c (new_environ): Made it return the new
	environment, not putting it in `environ'.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't give a "is up to date" message
	unless no files were remade and the state went from `cs_not_started'
	to `cs_finished', so repeat calls to finish jobs won't get the message.

Mon Sep 26 16:26:08 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Version 3.08.

	* make.texinfo (Commands: Execution): Documented that children will

	sequence after an ignored error.

	* remake.c (update_file): Don't print "`foo' is up to date" messages
	when update_file_1 returns while commands are executing.

	the bloody `struct file', dammit!!

	* commands.c (child_handler): Print out the "*** ..." error message
	when not under -i.  (I somehow forgot this.)

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Use name_mtime rather than file_mtime to
	re-get the mtime of a file whose commands have finished.

	* make.c (command_switches, decode_switches, decode_env_switches):
	Make all switches that take string args allow them right after the
	switch letter.

	function's command returning and set the global variable for
	expand_function to check.

	* variable.c (expand_function): For the `shell' function, instead of
	waiting for the child shell ourselves, let child_handler do it and
	loop around waiting for something to happen.

	* make.c (print_version): Made the copyright year static, not dynamic.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Don't return if FILE's state is
	`cs_deps_running'.  In that case, we need to run through and check

	starting a new job to run file commands.

	* commands.c (start_job): Made it set the state to `cs_running'.

	goal-making loop.

	* commands.c (child_handler): When commands finish, set the
	corresponding file's `update_status' and `updated' flags as
	appropriate, and reset the modtimes of the file and any `also_make'
	files it has.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Don't re-set `last_mtime' and set `updated'.

	* commands.c (fatal_error_signal): Don't swallow all the children
	with a loop around `wait ((union wait *) 0)'!!!

	* make.c (struct command_switch): Added `positive_int' type.
	(switches): Added -j (job_slots).
	(construct_makeflags, decode_switches, decode_env_switches):
	Handle`positive_int'-type switches.

	* glob.c (glob_vector): Rename local variable `vector' to `VeCtOr'.
	This is said to avoid a conflict with some system's global `vector'
	variable.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made the `shell' function use
	construct_command_argv and do its own child control and piping.

	* make.c (main): Turn standard input into a broken pipe after
	reading in all makefiles (the last time it will be needed).

	* commands.c (struct child): Remove `pipe_fd' member.  We don't use
	pipes any more.
	(start_job): Return 0 for success, 1 or failure (rather than void).
	Don't use pipes.  Don't turn the child's stdin into a broken pipe.
	(child_handler): Print "*** Error" messages when necessary.

	`noerror' members to keep track of info about a command thread.
	(start_job): New function to start a job and update the argument
	`struct child' to reflect its status.
	(execute_file_commands): Merged run_file_commands back in.
	Made it use new start_job function.

	* rule.c (freerule): Don't free the `struct commands' of the
	discarded rule.  It may be used in more than one place.

	* commands.c (execute_command_line): Made it not try to delete the
	possibly partly-made file.  The child_handler function will do this.
	(fatal_error_signal): Ditto + call kill_children.

	* make.h: Declare job_slots.

	* make.c (main): Collect goals in a dep chain and run through this
	chain waiting for a child, eliminating finished goals, updating all
	remaining goals, and quitting if they fail and not -k.

	* commands.c (child_handler): If called with SIG < 0, - SIG is the
	max number of children to bury.

	* commands.c (child_handler): If called with SIG as zero,
	block waiting for running children.
	(kill_children): Call child_handler with zero rather than SIGCHLD.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Use the `command_state' member of FILE
	and its dependencies to determine what commands are running, what to
	do, etc.  If commands or dep commands are running when we are
	called, return success (0).  If commands finished since the last
	time we were called, return their status.

	* commands.h: Declare kill_children.

	* commands.c: Define `struct child' to keep track of child
	processes, with the chain in `children'.
	(child_handler): New function to catch child-termination signals
	(SIGCHLD, or SIGCLD for USG), store the returned status in the
	appropriate structure, take the now-obsolete `struct child' out of
	the chain, and free its storage.
	(execute_file_commands): Put all of the stuff invloving running the
	commands into new function run_file_commands.  Execute_file_commands
	now does process management for the commands, while
	run_file_commands (which is run in a subprocess) runs the commands.
	(kill_children): New function to kill all running children by
	sending them signal SIG.  If there are any children still living
	after they are all sent SIG, they are all sent SIGKILL.

	* make.c (main): Catch SIGCHLD (SIGCLD for USG) with child_handler.

	* commands.h: Declare child_handler function.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Check the `command_state'
	member of FILE and return 0 if it is `cs_running' or
	`cs_deps_running' and return the stored status if it is `cs_finished'.

	* file.h (struct file): Added `command_state' member.

	* commands.c (execute_command_line): Add `$' to the list of
	characters special to the shell.

	chain after reading in all the makefiles.

	* make.c (main): Don't call install_default_pattern_rules or
	count_implicit_rule_limits.

	* make.h: Declare displace_pattern_rules and
	add_displaced_pattern_rules.

	* Makefile: Put tags files in the tarfile.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Get the modtime of the makefile via a stat
	call so that a later file_mtime call won't do VPATH search for it.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't turn off -t and -q if the makefile
	was a command-line target.

	* make.c (main): Enter command-line targets as files and set their
	`cmd_target' members.

	* file.h (struct file): Added `cmd_target' member.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Temporarily turn off -t and -q while
	updating makefiles.

	* make.c (main): Don't use arg 0 from other_args (which is now
	argv[0]; i.e., the program's name).

	* read.c (read_makefile): Only return nonzero if commands were
	actually run to remake the makefile.

	* remake.c (update_file_1): Set FILE->updated to -1 if no commands
	were actually run (because no update was done or -t was given).

	bad args if it tried to expand other_args->list.

	* read.c (read_all_makefiles): Made it not look at the `MAKE'
	variable, just use argv[0].

	* read.c (rerun_make): New function to re-exec make.

	* make.c (construct_makeflags, construct_argv): New functions to
	construct the `MAKEFLAGS' variable and to construct an arg list from
	parsed info.

	* read.c (read_makefile): New arg UPDATEIT, if nonzero, says to
	update the makefile as a target before reading it in.  When reading
	included makefiles, pass this as zero.  Now returns nonzero if the
	makefile was updated, zero if not.
	(read_all_makefiles): Pass a nonzero UPDATEIT arg to read_makefile
	for all default and -f makefiles and all makefiles from the
	`MAKEFILES' variable.  If any of the makefiles has changed, re-exec
	self to re-read them.

	* remake.c (update_file): Print a "File `foo' up to date'" message
	under -p.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Allocate one byte for each of

	* file.c: Increased number of hash buckets to 1007.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits): Moved comptation of
	`maxsuffix' to convert_to_pattern, since that function uses
	`maxsuffix', and must be called before count_implicit_rule_limits.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): If an existent (non-intermediate)
	dependendency was found via a terminal rule, set its
	`tried_implicit' flag, so it will never have implicit rule search done.

	* glob.c: Bug fix to avoid alloca(0).

	* arscan.c: USG and Sun386i fixes.

Thu Sep 15 19:40:26 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at helen.Berkeley.EDU)

	gets filled in with a malloc'd buffer containing the piped stdout of
	the command.
	(execute_file_commands): Use above (pass nil).

Mon Sep  5 17:03:49 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at hecuba.Berkeley.EDU)

	`VPATH' variable (by using variable_expand instead of lookup_variable).

	* read.c (conditional_line): Made it not swallow whitespace after
	the comma in an `ifeq' using the `(a,b)' syntax.

	* rule.c (count_implicit_rule_limits): Made it not crash if a
	pattern rule dep begins with `/'.

Sun Aug 28 15:51:12 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at homer.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.texinfo: Clarified that the arg to the `origin' function is a

	* read.c (record_files): Fixed bug which made double-colon entries
	make it read off into space.

	rather than dumping core.

Sun Aug 14 16:49:00 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (read_makefile): Made `include' filenames be
	variable-expanded.

Wed Aug 10 00:55:39 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Fixed bug which made -p
	dump core.  (This was a really idiotic bug.)

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Fixed a bug which made it make the
	`also_make' member of the file in question nil if the first of
	the successful rule's targets was the matching one.
	Made it use only as much storage as necessary in the `also_make'
	member.
	(create_pattern): Made it use only as much storage as necessary in
	the `lens' and `suffixes' members of the created rule.

	<errno.h>'s, but not all.

	* file.h (struct file): Added `also_make' member for multiple-target
	implicit rules.
	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it put the names of files updated by

	define a variable with the name of the whole definition when there
	was no space before the = or :=.

	* make.texinfo (Features): Made the changes which were made in RCS
	revision 2.7 but somehow lost since then.  Added -W.

	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): Made it print the origins of
	the variables.
	* rule.c (install_default_pattern_rules): Made it define the default
	variables with origin `o_default'.

	* make.texinfo: Documented -W.

	* make.c (decode_switches, main): Added the -W flag to give files a
	time-stamp of now, for a `what if' effect when used with -n.

	* commands.c (print_commands): Made it say `(built-in)' for commands
	that are built into the default ruleset.

	* read.c (record_file): Made .SUFFIXES get its deps frontwards (again).

	.SUFFIXES's deps frontwards, so the converted rules will not be in
	reverse order.

	* rule.c (new_pattern_rule): Fixed a bug wherein it would keep
	searching after it had removed a matching rule and ended up diddling
	with freed storage.

	* rule.c (freerule): Made it take the given rule off the chain.
	(new_pattern_rule, count_implicit_rule_limits): Use freerule to
	remove rules from the chain.

	* vpath.c (construct_vpath_list): Made it return after cleaning out
	all previous searchpaths when given a nil DIRPATH arg, so it won't
	go into the construction code and dump core dereferencing a nil
	pointer.

	* variable.c (patsubst_expand): Fixed a bug which made it not match
	correctly and sometimes dump core.

Mon Aug  8 16:35:48 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (default_suffix_rules): Made the .texinfo.dvi rule remove
	the files used in the comparison to determine whether or not a
	second TeX run is necessary.

	* make.texinfo (Top): Changed `last updated' date to be correct (for
	the last time it was updated, not today).  Changed `for version
	3.00' since it's not going to be called that.

Sat Aug  6 19:51:10 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* commands.c (print_commands): Added this function to print the

	changed `struct rule' and act accordingly.
	(freerule): Added this function to free all the storage used by a rule.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it grok multiple targets of pattern
	rules.  The matching is done properly, but at present, only the
	matching pattern's target is used to give deps and commands.

Fri Aug  5 18:00:29 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (struct rule): Changed name, namelen, and patsuffix members
	to targets, lens, and suffixes, which are arrays, for multiple targets.
	(create_pattern_rule): Now takes first arg TARGETS, a nil-terminated
	array of targets, rather than a single target and patsuffix pointer.

	* read.c (record_files): If it finds an implicit pattern rule, it
	collects all the targets into an array and passes the whole thing to
	create_pattern_rule.  If there are non-pattern targets, it is a
	fatal error.

Tue Aug  2 15:06:38 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (readline): Split backslash-newline checking from reading
	and buffer-expanding.
	(getline): Created to do the reading and buffer-expanding formerly
	done in readline.

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it reject nonterminal match-anything
	rules when a specific rule has matched, rather than rejecting
	terminal match-anything rules in this case.

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Fixed a bug caused when the change to
	make it only recognize two-suffix rules whose target suffixes
	precede their dependency suffixes which made it work in the opposite
	direction (even worse than it started out).

	* rule.c (pattern_search): Made it reject nonterminal match-anything
	rules as intermediate targets when searching for both real and
	intermediate dependencies, rather than only when searching for
	intermediate ones.

Sun Jul 31 00:33:56 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (convert_to_pattern): Made it only recognize two-suffix
	rules whose target suffix comes before the dependency suffix in the
	.SUFFIXES list.

	* variable.c (define_automatic_variables): Made all automatic
	variables be defined with origin `o_automatic'.

	* variable.h: Added `o_automatic' to `enum variable_origin'

	* file.c (remove_intermediates): Made it not print an error message
	if the error was that the file does not exist.

	* rule.c: Removed `recursive' member from `struct rule'.

	* remake.c (library_file_mtime): Made it not use the directory hash
	functions, as reading in and hashing /usr/lib and /lib is slow and
	most likely unnecessary.

	* remake.c (remake_file): Changed message from ``No specification
	for making'' to ``No way to make'' so it will be short enough that
	most filenames will fit on a line.
	Made it look at the `recursive' member of the `struct commands',
	rather than of the `struct file' (which no longer has one).

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Made it look at the
	`recursive' member of the `struct commands', rather than of the
	`struct file' (which no longer has one).

	* file.h: Removed `recursive' member from `struct file'.

	* commands.h: Added `recursive' member to `struct commands'.

	* dep.h: Removed unused `quotedparen' member from `struct nameseq'
	and `struct dep'.

	* read.c (dequote): Removed this function.
	(multi_glob): Removed reference to `quotedparen' member of
	a `struct nameseq' and calls to dequote.

	* read.c (record_files): Made it set the stem for $* for all static
	pattern rules, not just those with commands given at that time.
	Removed check for recursive commands.
	Made it check for pairs of .SUFFIXES dependencies to reject as
	default goals as well as single ones (that don't start with dots).
	(read_makefile): Added checks for recursive commands to set
	the `recursive' flag in the `struct commands'.

Sat Jul 30 15:47:23 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (find_next_token): Made the LENGTHPTR arg optionally nil.

	* make.c: Removed `files_made' variable which is defined static in
	remake.c and used only there.
	(main): Cleaned up somewhat.
	(decode_switches): Cleaned up a bit.  Made an unknown option be a
	non-fatal error.
	(decode_env_switches): Made LEN arg unsigned.  Cleaned up.
	(print_version): Made it say ``see the source'' rather than ``see
	the source file'', since there is more than one.

	* file.h: Made `num_intermediates' declared unsigned.

	* file.c: Made `num_intermediates' variable unsigned.
	(remove_intermediates): Removed unused FORMAT arg.
	(enter_file): Made it handle double-colon files properly, adding the
	new entry as the old entry's prev pointer.

	* dir.c: Re-indented the `struct dir' definition to be right.
	(dir_load): Cleaned up slighty.
	(file_exists_p): Removed comment saying we could use `access', since
	that is a bad idea (except for setuid programs).  Cleaned up slightly.

	* commands.c: Changed some comments slightly.
	(execute_file_commands): Cleaned up a bit.  Changed some comments,
	added others.  Moved freeing of storage for $^ and $? to the same
	place as for the other automatic variables.
	(execute_command_line): Made `#' trigger a shell.
	Added some comments.  Cleaned up a bit.  Put all the special chars
	that trigger shells into an array easily changeable at the top.

	* ar.c: Added comments explaining each function.
	(ar_scan_1): Merged into ar_member_date.
	(ar_member_date): Changed call to ar_scan_1 to the body of that
	function.
	(ar_member_date_1): Simplified to a ?: expression rather than an
	if-else statement.
	(ar_member_touch): Changed error handling around a bit.
	None of these errors are fatal now.

	* variable.c (subst_expand): Added a new arg BY_WORD, to do substs
	only on full words.
	(patsubst_expand): Fixed bug which made calls whose patterns
	contained no `%' to not work correctly, by using above.
	(variable_expand): Pass extra arg to `subst_expand'.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Fixed bug which made `foreach' calls
	with one-word lists run off into never-never land.

Fri Jul 29 20:12:36 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made a very minor speed improvement
	by avoiding an unnecessary strlen call.

Wed Jul 27 16:01:47 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (default_suffixes): Rearranged the list somewhat; added
	`.el' and `.elc' to speed things up (especially when building
	Emacs), for the same reason `.h' is there.

	* read.c (record_files): Changed `lineno' from `long' to
	`unsigned int'.

Sun Jul 24 02:15:30 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* variable.c (expand_function): Eliminated use of `wstok'
	because it is non-reentrant and unreliable.
	Fixed a minor bug which would cause something not to be freed.
	* make.c (wstok): Removed `wstok' because it is no longer used.

	* variable.c (expand_function): Made `foreach' function put
	spaces between output texts like it's supposed to.

Sat Jul 23 17:32:55 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* rule.c (default_suffixes, default_suffix_rules): Added rule
	to make %.dvi from %.texinfo.

	* dir.c (print_dir_data_base): Made it say a bit more.

Fri Jul 22 23:13:16 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* make.c (print_data_base): Split this function up into one
	for each thing.
	* variable.c (print_variable_data_base): One of the above.
	* rule.c (print_rule_data_base): Ditto.
	* file.c (print_file_data_base): Ditto.
	* dir.c (print_dir_data_base): Ditto.

	* rule.c (install_pattern_rule): Fixed a bug which caused the
	terminal and recursive flags to always be zero for rules
	entered by this function.

	* make.texinfo (Rules: Double-colon): Added a paragraph
	explaining the purpose of double-colon rules.

	* make.texinfo (Implicit: Catalogue of Rules): Updated to
	reflect new C++, TeX, Web, and Texinfo rules.  Other slight
	editorial changes.

	* commands.c (execute_file_commands): Fixed a bug wherein
	random memory could get written for files with no deps.

Wed Jul 20 19:30:31 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c (readline): Fix bug wherein it would not recognize a
	backslash-newline if the buffer filled up and was enlarged
	right before reading the newline.

Tue Jul 19 19:55:02 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at chilli.Berkeley.EDU)

	* read.c: Added default suffix rules for .cc (using $(C++),
	which defaults to `g++', and $(C++FLAGS)), .tex, .dvi, .web
	and .cweb (using $(TEX), $(WEAVE), $(TANGLE), $(CWEAVE) and
	$(CTANGLE)).

Sat Jul 16 21:24:28 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Made error formats use %u rather than %ld for line numbers,
	which are now unsigned int's rather than long's.

	* read.c (conditional_line): Fixed some bugs caused by use of
	unsigned int rather than int in one place.

	* read.c (conditional_line): Put the info about active
	conditionals in a struct.
	(read_makefile): Make a new struct of info about conditionals
	for included makefiles and restore the old one after the
	included makefile has been read.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Don't try to read a makefile with
	name "" after giving an error message because an `include'
	directive gave no filename.

	* read.c (read_makefile): Give an error message for
	non-whitespace text after the filename in an `include' directive.

	* make.c (error): Take five args, like `fatal'.  It managed to
	lose with only two.  Is there a better way to do this without vfprintf?

	* read.c (read_makefile): Commands consisting of only
	whitespace are not the same as no commands.  I thought I'd
	fixed this bug months ago; it seems to have come back.

	* make.c (collapse_continuations): All whitespace around a
	backslash-newline combination is turned into a single space.

	* Added COPYING file and copyright notices to all files.

	* make.texinfo (Running: Goals): Fix a typo.

	* read.c (do_define): Take an arg for the origin of the
	variable being defined.
	(read_makefile): Grok `override define'.

	* make.texinfo (Variables: Override Directive, Defining):
	Document the `override define' combination directive.

	* ar.c (ar_member_date): Make a 0 return from `ar_scan' return
	(time_t) -1 (nonexistent file), rather than (time_t) 0, which,
	when put in the `struct file', makes `file_mtime' try to get
	the mtime over and over again.

	* variable.c (pattern_matches): Fix a bug that made patterns
	not beginning with `%' never match.

Fri Jul 15 21:01:44 1988  Roland McGrath  (mcgrath at tully.Berkeley.EDU)

	* Took Make out of RCS.

	* Split the monolithic `make.c' into several smaller files.
