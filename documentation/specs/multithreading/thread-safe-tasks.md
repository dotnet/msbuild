# Thread-Safe Tasks

## Overview

MSBuild's current execution model assumes that tasks have exclusive control over the entire process during execution. This allows tasks to freely modify global process state such as environment variables, the current working directory, and other process-level resources. This design works well for MSBuild's approach of executing builds in separate processes for parallelization. With the introduction of multithreaded execution within a single MSBuild process, multiple tasks can now run concurrently. This requires a new task design to ensure that multiple tasks do not access/modify shared process state, and the relative paths are resolved correctly.

To enable this multithreaded execution model, tasks will declare their capability to run in multiple threads within one process. These capabilities are referred to as **thread-safety** capabilities and the corresponding tasks are called **thread-safe tasks**. Thread-safe tasks must avoid using APIs that modify or depend on global process state, as this could cause conflicts when multiple tasks execute concurrently. See [Thread-Safe Tasks API Analysis Reference](thread-safe-tasks-api-analysis.md) for detailed guidelines. Task authors will also get access to a `TaskEnvironment` that provides safe alternatives to global process state APIs. For example, task authors should use `TaskEnvironment.GetAbsolutePath()` instead of `Path.GetFullPath()` to ensure correct path resolution in multithreaded scenarios.

Tasks that are not thread-safe can still participate in multithreaded builds. MSBuild will execute these tasks in separate TaskHost processes to provide process-level isolation.

## Thread-Safe Capability Indicators

Task authors can declare thread-safe capabilities in two different ways:
1. **Interface-Based Thread-Safe Capability Declaration** - Provides access to thread-safe APIs through `TaskEnvironment` to be used in the task code.
2. **Attribute-Based Thread-Safe Capability Declaration** - Allows existing tasks to declare its ability run in multithreaded mode without code changes. It is a **compatibility bridge option**.

Tasks that use `TaskEnvironment` cannot load in older MSBuild versions that do not support multithreading features, requiring authors to drop support for older MSBuild versions. To address this challenge, MSBuild provides a compatibility bridge that allows certain tasks targeting older MSBuild versions to participate in multithreaded builds. While correct absolute path resolution can be and should be achieved without accessing `TaskEnvironment` in tasks that use compatibility bridge options, tasks must avoid relying on environment variables or modifying global process state.

So, task authors who need to support older MSBuild versions will have three choices:
1. **Maintain separate implementations** - Create and support both thread-safe and legacy versions of the same task.
2. **Use compatibility bridge approaches** - Rely on MSBuild's ability to run legacy tasks in multithreaded mode without access to `TaskEnvironment`.
3. **Accept reduced performance** - Tasks will execute more slowly than their thread-safe versions because they must run in a separate TaskHost process

### Interface-Based Thread-Safe Capability Declaration

Tasks indicate thread-safety capabilities by implementing the `IMultiThreadableTask` interface.

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Build.Framework;
public interface IMultiThreadableTask : ITask
{
    TaskEnvironment TaskEnvironment { get; set; }
}
```

Similar to how MSBuild provides the abstract `Task` class with default implementations for the `ITask` interface, MSBuild will offer a `MultiThreadableTask` abstract class with default implementations for the `IMultiThreadableTask` interface. Task authors will only need to implement the `Execute` method for the `ITask` interface and use `TaskEnvironment` within it to create their thread-safe tasks.

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Build.Utilities;
public abstract class MultiThreadableTask : Task, IMultiThreadableTask
{
    public TaskEnvironment TaskEnvironment{ get; set; }
}
```

Task authors who want to support older MSBuild versions need to:
- Maintain both thread-safe and legacy implementations.
- Use conditional task declarations based on MSBuild version to select which assembly to load the task from.

**Note:** Consider backporting `IMultiThreadableTask` to MSBuild 17.14 for graceful failure when the interface is used.

### Attribute-Based Thread-Safe Capability Declaration

Task authors can indicate thread-safety capabilities by marking their task classes with a specific attribute. Tasks marked with this attribute can run in multithreaded builds but do not have access to `TaskEnvironment` APIs.

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Build.Framework;
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = false)]
internal class MSBuildMultiThreadableTaskAttribute : Attribute
{
    public MSBuildMultiThreadableTaskAttribute() { }
}
```

MSBuild detects `MSBuildMultiThreadableTaskAttribute` by its namespace and name only, ignoring the defining assembly, which allows customers to define the attribute in their own assemblies alongside their tasks. Since MSBuild does not ship the attribute, customers using newer MSBuild versions should prefer the Interface-Based Thread-Safe Capability Declaration.

For tasks to be eligible for multithreaded execution using this approach, they must satisfy the following conditions:
- The task must not modify global process state (environment variables, working directory)
- The task must not depend on global process state, including relative path resolution

#### API Usage Example

```csharp
[MSBuildMultiThreadableTask]
public class MyTask : Task {...}
```

## TaskEnvironment API

The `TaskEnvironment` provides thread-safe alternatives to APIs that use global process state, enabling tasks to execute safely in a multithreaded environment.

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Build.Framework;
public interface IMultiThreadableTask : ITask
{
    TaskEnvironment TaskEnvironment { get; set; }
}

public class TaskEnvironment
{ 
    public virtual AbsolutePath ProjectDirectory { get; internal set; }

    // This function resolves paths relative to ProjectDirectory.
    public virtual AbsolutePath GetAbsolutePath(string path);
    
    public virtual string? GetEnvironmentVariable(string name);
    public virtual IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> GetEnvironmentVariables();
    public virtual void SetEnvironmentVariable(string name, string? value);

    public virtual ProcessStartInfo GetProcessStartInfo();
}
```

The `TaskEnvironment` class that MSBuild provides is not thread-safe. Task authors who spawn multiple threads within their task implementation must provide their own synchronization when accessing the task environment from multiple threads. However, each task receives its own isolated environment object, so synchronization with other concurrent tasks is not required.

### Path Handling

To prevent common thread-safety issues related to path handling, we introduce path type that is implicitly convertible to string:

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Build.Framework;
public readonly struct AbsolutePath
{
    // Default value returns string.Empty for Path property
    public string Path { get; }
    internal AbsolutePath(string path, bool ignoreRootedCheck) { }
    public AbsolutePath(string path); // Checks Path.IsPathRooted
    public AbsolutePath(string path, AbsolutePath basePath) { }
    public static implicit operator string(AbsolutePath path) { }
    public override string ToString() => Path;
}
```

`AbsolutePath` converts implicitly to string for seamless integration with existing File/Directory APIs.

### API Usage Example

```csharp
public bool Execute(...)
{
    // Use APIs provided by TaskEnvironment
    string envVar = TaskEnvironment.GetEnvironmentVariable("EnvVar");
       
    // Convert string properties to strongly-typed paths and use them in standard File/Directory APIs
    AbsolutePath path = TaskEnvironment.GetAbsolutePath("SomePath");
    string content = File.ReadAllText(path);
    string content2 = File.ReadAllText(path.ToString());
    string content3 = File.ReadAllText(path.Path);
    ...
}
```

## Appendix: Alternatives

This appendix collects alternative approaches considered during design.

### Alternative Approach: API Hooking

An alternative approach to the `TaskEnvironment` API could be to use API hooking (such as Microsoft Detours) to automatically virtualize global process state without requiring any changes from task authors.

The main advantages of API hooking include requiring no action from task authors since existing tasks would work without modification or recompilation, and having no compatibility concerns with older MSBuild versions. However, it would be a Windows-only solution, making it unsuitable for cross-platform scenarios. 

### Alternative to Attribute-Based Thread-Safe Capability Declaration

We considered making the thread-safety signal using the task declaration (for example, a `ThreadSafe="true"` attribute on `UsingTask`) so that project authors could declare compatibility without changing task assemblies. However, because older MSBuild versions treat unknown attributes in task declarations as errors, this approach would require updating older MSBuild versions or servicing them to ignore the attribute.
