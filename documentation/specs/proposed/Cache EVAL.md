# Evaluation goes fast
*The objective of this one-pager is to provide clear and concise information about a feature or project to foster inclusion and collaboration by enabling anyone who is interested to learn the essential information, such as the project's goals, motivation, impact, and risks. The points and questions in each section are illustrative, they are not intended as a definite list of questions to be answered.*

## Description
 - Short summary of the feature or effort.

 - We could do profiling
 - Jit compilation o MSBuild itself. 
 - We could cache at eval

 Constraint - needs to work as it does today, but fast. We can break some edge cases.

## Goals and Motivation
 - What are we trying to achieve and why? 

 We evaluate all the time, a lot of times we don't need to be doing that - like up-to-date builds. It would increase the dev loop performance. Evaluate go fast.

## Impact
Guidance: This document should not be an OKR. Let's keep the impact general here.
Questions to consider:
 - What is the impact? 
 - Who will benefit from the feature?
 - How does success look like?
 - Are there any metrics or key results that could be quantified? 

## Stakeholders
Questions to consider:
 - Who are the stakeholders? 
 - For projects with concrete stakeholders, once the project is done how does a successful handover to the stakeholder look like? 

## Risks
Questions to consider:
 - Will the effort or feature cause breaking changes for existing consumers? 
 - Are there any unknowns that might derail the effort? 
 - Are there any dependencies we don’t have control over? 
 - Is there a hard deadline that needs to be met? 
 - What threatens completion of the feature? 
 - What is the impact of failing to deliver the feature?

## Cost
Questions to consider:
 - What is the estimated cost of the end-to-end effort? 
 - How accurate is the cost? 

## Plan
 - High-level milestones, with estimate effort for tasks.
