      With MSBuild 12, we've changed MSBuildToolsPath to for the first time point to a directory
      outside of the .NET Framework.  As a result of this, there were several targets files, of which
      this was one, that were being referenced as out of MSBuildToolsPath that are now no longer there.

      Thus, we are shimming those targets files so that they do still appear in MSBuildToolsPath, so that
      consumers of them are not broken, but since the targets files themselves are still part of .NET,
      the shim will internally simply redirect to the real copy of the targets file in the .NET Framework.

      This target in $(MSBuildFrameworkToolsPath)\Microsoft.WorkflowBuildExtensions.targets does bad
      things to builds inside Visual Studio. Specifically, it generates files *only* when building from
      within VS, for both real and design-time builds. This leads to all kinds of build problems.

      In Dev16 we no longer need these files to exist on disk for Workflow Designer scenarios. We can't
      modify $(MSBuildFrameworkToolsPath)\Microsoft.WorkflowBuildExtensions.targets because that would
      break the Workflow Designer for older versions of VS. Instead, we effectively turn it off by
      overriding it with a no-op implementation here.
