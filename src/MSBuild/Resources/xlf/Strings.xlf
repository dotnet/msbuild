                     multiple loggers, specify each logger separately.

        <source>  /binaryLogger[:[LogFile=]output.binlog[;ProjectImports={None,Embed,ZipFile}]]
                     Serializes all build events to a compressed binary file.
                     By default the file is in the current directory and named
                     "msbuild.binlog". The binary log is a detailed description
                     of the build process that can later be used to reconstruct
                     text logs and used by other analysis tools. A binary log
                     is usually 10-20x smaller than the most detailed text
                     diagnostic-level log, but it contains more information.
                     (Short form: /bl)

                     The binary logger by default collects the source text of
                     project files, including all imported projects and target
                     files encountered during the build. The optional
                     ProjectImports switch controls this behavior:

                      ProjectImports=None     - Don't collect the project
                                                imports.
                      ProjectImports=Embed    - Embed project imports in the
                                                log file.
                      ProjectImports=ZipFile  - Save project files to
                                                output.projectimports.zip
                                                where output is the same name
                                                as the binary log file name.

                     The default setting for ProjectImports is Embed.
                     Note: the logger does not collect non-MSBuild source files
                     such as .cs, .cpp etc.

                     A .binlog file can be "played back" by passing it to
                     msbuild.exe as an argument instead of a project/solution.
                     Other loggers will receive the information contained
                     in the log file as if the original build was happening.
                     You can read more about the binary log and its usages at:
                     https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/wiki/Binary-Log

                     Examples:

        <source>  /restore[:True|False]
                     Runs a target named Restore prior to building
                     other targets.  This is useful when your project
                     tree requires packages to be restored before they
                     can be built. Specifying /restore is the same as
                     specifying /restore:True.  Use the parameter to
                     override a value that comes from a response file.
                     (Short form: /r)

      LOCALIZATION: "/restore" and "/r" should not be localized.
