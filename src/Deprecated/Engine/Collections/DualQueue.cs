    /// writing to. The writing queue is protected by a mutex so that multiple threads can write to
    /// it. When a reading thread wants to read all the queued items, we swap the writing queue
    /// for another (empty) one. The writing queue then becomes the reading queue, and the empty
    /// queue becomes the new writing queue. This allows the reader to safely read from the swapped
    /// out queue without regard to new items being written to the other queue.
