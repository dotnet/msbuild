                     The default setting for ProjectImports is Embed.
                     Note: the logger does not collect non-MSBuild source files
                     such as .cs, .cpp etc.

                     A .binlog file can be "played back" by passing it to
                     msbuild.exe as an argument instead of a project/solution.
                     Other loggers will receive the information contained
                     in the log file as if the original build was happening.
                     You can read more about the binary log and its usages at:
                     https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog

                     Examples:
                       -bl
                       -bl:output.binlog
                       -bl:output.binlog;ProjectImports=None

                     Serializes all build events to a compressed binary file.
                     By default the file is in the current directory and named
                     "msbuild.binlog". The binary log is a detailed description
                     of the build process that can later be used to reconstruct
                     text logs and used by other analysis tools. A binary log
                     is usually 10-20x smaller than the most detailed text
                     diagnostic-level log, but it contains more information.
                     (Short form: -bl)

                     The binary logger by default collects the source text of
                     project files, including all imported projects and target
                     files encountered during the build. The optional
                     ProjectImports switch controls this behavior:

                      ProjectImports=None     - Don't collect the project
                                                imports.
                      ProjectImports=Embed    - Embed project imports in the
                                                log file.
                      ProjectImports=ZipFile  - Save project files to
                                                output.projectimports.zip

                                                as the binary log file name.
