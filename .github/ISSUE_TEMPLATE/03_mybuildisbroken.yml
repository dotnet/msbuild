        NOTE: The MSBuild team receives a lot of issues and we need to prioritize them accordingly. Please understand that we may not get to your issue for some time.
        Here are some useful links to help you figure out what's wrong.
        * [Our documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation)

        Include as much of the following as possible: 
        * a minimal sample project that reproduces the issue, 
        * your zipped project, 
        * IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour, 
        * your command line invocation.
        
        If providing steps to reproduce the issue proves difficult, consider attaching a binlog:
        * [Details on sharing binary logs](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog)
        * [More information on binary logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md)
        
        NOTE: Binary logs capture environment information. Ensure it does not include any information you don't want to be public before you attach one.
        If you want to share one just with Microsoft, you can [report a problem through Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/report) and share it privately with Microsoft.
