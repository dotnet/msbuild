        Include as much of the following as possible: 
        * a minimal sample project that reproduces the issue, 
        * your zipped project, 
        * IDE / CLI steps to create the project and reproduce the behaviour, 
        * your command line invocation.
        
        If providing steps to reproduce the issue proves difficult, consider attaching a binlog:
        * [Details on sharing binary logs](https://aka.ms/msbuild/binlog)
        * [More information on binary logs](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/blob/main/documentation/wiki/Binary-Log.md)
