# MSBuild - Microsoft Build Engine

This repo contains the code for the MSBuild build engine, including its public C# API, its internal implementation of the MSBuild programming language, and core targets and tasks used for builds for .NET and Visual Studio.

Performance is very important--minimize allocations, avoid LINQ, and use the most efficient algorithms possible. The code should be easy to read and understand, but performance is the top priority.

The code is written in C# and should follow the .NET coding conventions. Use the latest C# features where appropriate, including C# 13 features and especially collection expressions--prefer `[]` to `new Type[]`.

You should generally match the style of surrounding code when making edits, but if making a substantial change, you can modernize more aggressively.
New files should use nullable types but don't refactor aggressively existing code.

Generate tests for new codepaths, and add tests for any bugs you fix. Use the existing test framework, which is xUnit with Shouldly assertions. Use Shouldly assertions for all assertions in modified code, even if the file is predominantly using xUnit assertions.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Working Effectively

#### Bootstrap and Build the Repository
NEVER build the repository with just `dotnet build MSBuild.sln` or `dotnet build src/.../Project.csproj`.
Run these commands in sequence to set up a complete development environment:

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Full build with restore - NEVER CANCEL: Takes ~2-3 minutes. Set timeout to 300+ seconds.
build.cmd --build

# Set up bootstrap environment for using built MSBuild
artifacts\msbuild-build-env.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Full build with restore - NEVER CANCEL: Takes ~2-3 minutes. Set timeout to 300+ seconds.
./build.sh --build

# Set up bootstrap environment for using built MSBuild
source artifacts/sdk-build-env.sh
```

### Test the Repository
**Windows:**
```cmd
# Run all tests - NEVER CANCEL: Takes ~9 minutes but some tests may fail (this is expected). Set timeout to 900+ seconds.
build.cmd --test

# Run individual test project (recommended for validation):
artifacts\msbuild-build-env.bat
dotnet test src/Framework.UnitTests/Microsoft.Build.Framework.UnitTests.csproj
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Run all tests - NEVER CANCEL: Takes ~9 minutes but some tests may fail (this is expected). Set timeout to 900+ seconds.
./build.sh --test

# Run individual test project (recommended for validation):
source artifacts/sdk-build-env.sh
dotnet test src/Framework.UnitTests/Microsoft.Build.Framework.UnitTests.csproj
```

**CRITICAL**: Some unit tests fail in the full test suite due to environment/CI dependencies. This is EXPECTED and normal in development environments. Individual test projects typically work correctly.

### Using the Built MSBuild

After building, use the bootstrap environment to work with the locally built MSBuild:

**Windows:**
```cmd
# Set up environment (run after every new shell session)
artifacts\msbuild-build-env.bat

# Verify environment is working
dotnet --version
# Should show something like: 10.0.100-preview.7.25372.107

# Build a project using the built MSBuild
dotnet build src/Samples/Dependency/Dependency.csproj

# Run MSBuild directly
dotnet artifacts/bin/bootstrap/core/MSBuild.dll --help
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Set up environment (run after every new shell session)
source artifacts/sdk-build-env.sh

# Verify environment is working
dotnet --version
# Should show something like: 10.0.100-preview.7.25372.107

# Build a project using the built MSBuild
dotnet build src/Samples/Dependency/Dependency.csproj

# Run MSBuild directly
dotnet artifacts/bin/bootstrap/core/MSBuild.dll --help
```

## Validation

### Always Test These Scenarios After Making Changes:
1. **Full build validation**: 
   - Windows: `build.cmd --build` must complete successfully
   - macOS/Linux: `./build.sh --build` must complete successfully
2. **Bootstrap environment**: 
   - Windows: `artifacts\msbuild-build-env.bat && dotnet --version` shows correct preview version
   - macOS/Linux: `source artifacts/sdk-build-env.sh && dotnet --version` shows correct preview version
3. **Sample build**: `dotnet build src/Samples/Dependency/Dependency.csproj` succeeds
4. **Individual tests**: Choose a relevant test project and run `dotnet test [project.csproj]`
5. **MSBuild help**: `dotnet artifacts/bin/bootstrap/core/MSBuild.dll --help` shows usage

### Manual Testing Requirements:
- ALWAYS test the full build after code changes
- Verify the bootstrap environment works correctly with `dotnet --version`
- Test MSBuild executable can display help and basic functionality
- Build at least one sample project to verify core functionality

## Common Tasks

### Build Commands and Timing
**Windows:**
- **`build.cmd --build`** - Full build: ~2-3 minutes. NEVER CANCEL. Use 300+ second timeout.
- **`build.cmd --test`** - Run all tests: ~9 minutes with some failures expected. NEVER CANCEL. Use 900+ second timeout.
- **`build.cmd --clean`** - Clean build artifacts: ~30 seconds.

**macOS/Linux:**
- **`./build.sh --build`** - Full build: ~2-3 minutes. NEVER CANCEL. Use 300+ second timeout.
- **`./build.sh --test`** - Run all tests: ~9 minutes with some failures expected. NEVER CANCEL. Use 900+ second timeout.
- **`./build.sh --clean`** - Clean build artifacts: ~30 seconds.

### Development Workflow
1. Make your changes to source code
2. Run the full build to compile (WAIT for completion - takes 2-3 minutes):
   - Windows: `build.cmd --build`
   - macOS/Linux: `./build.sh --build`
3. Set up environment:
   - Windows: `artifacts\msbuild-build-env.bat`
   - macOS/Linux: `source artifacts/sdk-build-env.sh`
4. Test your changes: `dotnet build src/Samples/Dependency/Dependency.csproj`
5. Run relevant individual tests, not the full test suite
6. Commit your changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build fails with "Could not resolve SDK":**
- Ensure you run `source artifacts/sdk-build-env.sh` after building
- Verify `dotnet --version` shows the preview/RC/internal version (e.g. 10.0.100-preview.7.25372.107)

**Tests fail:**
- Run individual test projects instead: `dotnet test src/Framework.UnitTests/Microsoft.Build.Framework.UnitTests.csproj`

**Certificate errors with external projects:**
- Use the repository's sample projects for testing instead of creating new external projects
- The bootstrap environment is designed for building the MSBuild repository itself

### Files You Should NOT Modify
- `global.json` - Controls .NET SDK version
- `NuGet.config` - Package source configuration
- `artifacts/` directory contents - Generated during build
- `.dotnet/` directory contents - Local SDK location used to build
