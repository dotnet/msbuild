# Expert Code Review

Review pull request #${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }} using the `expert-reviewer` agent defined at `.github/agents/expert-reviewer.md`.

## Instructions

1. Fetch the full diff for the pull request.
2. Call the `expert-reviewer` agent. Make sure to call it as subagent (`task` tool, `agent_type: "general-purpose"`, `model: "claude-opus-4.6"`). And make sure to follow the guidance on subagent calls from within the `expert-reviewer` agent. We expect 2+ levels of agents to be called.
3. Do **not** post comments or reviews yourself, except for the fallback in step 4 if the subagent posts nothing. The subagent will post its own comments using the available safe-output tools:
   - **Inline review comments** on specific diff lines via `create_pull_request_review_comment`
   - **Design-level concerns** (not tied to a line) via `add_comment`
   - **Final review verdict** (COMMENT or REQUEST_CHANGES) via `submit_pull_request_review`
   - **Never use APPROVE** — the agent must not count as a PR approval. Use COMMENT for clean reviews.
4. If the subagent does not post anything (e.g. no issues found), this is the only exception to step 3: post a brief fallback review using `submit_pull_request_review` with event `COMMENT` (not `APPROVE`). Do not use `add_comment` for this fallback.
