.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]dotnet\ clean\f[] command cleans the output of the previous build.
It's implemented as an MSBuild target, so the project is evaluated when the command is run.
Only the outputs created during the build are cleaned.
Both intermediate (\f[I]obj\f[]) and final output (\f[I]bin\f[]) folders are cleaned.
.SS Arguments
.PP
\f[C]PROJECT\f[]
.PP
The MSBuild project to clean.
If a project file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in \f[I]proj\f[] and uses that file.
