## Welcome to dotnet sdk

Core functionality needed to create .NET Core projects, that is shared between VisualStudio and CLI.

* MSBuild tasks can be found under [/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/](src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks).
* Project templates are under [src/Templates/ProjectTemplates/](src/Templates/ProjectTemplates)

Please refer to [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli) for .NET Core CLI source code, and to [dotnet/roslyn-project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-project-system) for the project system work that is specific to Visual Studio "15".
