	an eval to trap errors) and if it exists, use POSIX::getcwd to
	find the working directory.  If it doesn't exist, go back to the

	* test_driver.pl: Reset the environment to a clean value every
	time before we invoke make.  I'm suspicious that the environment
	isn't handled the same way in Windows as it is in UNIX, and some

	Create an %extraENV hash tests can set to add more env. vars.
	* tests/scripts/features/export: Change to use %extraENV.

	* scripts/options/dash-q: Add a test for Savannah bug # 7144.

	* scripts/options/symlinks: New file to test checking of symlink
	timestamps.  Can't use filename dash-L because it conflicts with
	dash-l on case-insensitive filesystems.

	* scripts/variables/MAKEFILE_LIST, scripts/variables/MFILE_LIST:
	Rename MAKEFILE_LIST test to MFILE_LIST, for systems that need 8.3
	unique filenames.

2005-02-26  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* test_driver.pl (compare_output): If a basic comparison of the
	log and answer doesn't match, try harder: change all backslashes
	to slashes and all CRLF to LF.  This helps on DOS/Windows systems.

2005-02-09  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/recursion: Test command line variable settings:
	only one instance of a given variable should be provided.

2004-11-30  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@kolpackov.net>

	* tests/scripts/functions/abspath: New file: test `abspath'
	built-in function.

	* tests/scripts/functions/realpath: New file: test `realpath'
	built-in function.

2004-11-28  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/options/dash-C [WINDOWS32]: Add a test for bug #10252;
	this doesn't really test anything useful in UNIX but...

	* scripts/variables/SHELL: New file: test proper handling of SHELL
	according to POSIX rules.  Fixes bug #1276.

2004-10-21  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@kolpackov.net>

	makestring or answer if they are completely empty.

	* scripts/features/patternrules: Rename from implicit_prereq_eval.

	* scripts/test_template: Rework the template.

2004-09-21  Boris Kolpackov  <boris@kolpackov.net>

	* run_make_tests.pl: Change `#!/usr/local/bin/perl' to be
	`#!/usr/bin/env perl'.

	* scripts/features/implicit_prereq_eval: Test implicit rule
	prerequisite evaluation code.

2004-09-21  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* run_make_tests.pl (run_make_test): Enhance to allow the make
	string to be undef: in that case it reuses the previous make
	string.  Allows multiple tests on the same makefile.

	* scripts/variables/flavors: Add some tests for prefix characters
	interacting with define/endef variables.

2004-09-20  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/substitution: Rewrite to use run_make_test()
	interface, and add test for substitution failures reported by
	Markus Mauhart <qwe123@chello.at>.

2004-03-22  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* test_driver.pl (run_each_test, toplevel, compare_output): Change
	to track both the testing categories _AND_ the number of
	individual tests, and report both sets of numbers.

2004-02-21  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/origin: Set our own environment variable
	rather than relying on $HOME.

2004-01-21  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/conditionals: Test arguments to ifn?def which
	contain whitespace (such as a function that is evaluated).  Bug
	#7257.

2004-01-07  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/order_only: Test order-only prerequisites in

	* scripts/features/patspecific_vars: Test multiple patterns
	matching the same target--Bug #1405.

2003-04-09  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* run_make_tests.pl (set_more_defaults): A new $port_type of
	'OS/2' for (surprise!) OS/2.  Also choose a wait time of 2 seconds
	for OS/2.

2003-03-28  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/targets/SECONDARY: Test the "global" .SECONDARY (with
	not prerequisites)--Bug #2515.

2003-01-30  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/targetvars: Test very long target-specific
	variable definition lines (longer than the default make buffer
	length).  Tests patch # 1022.

	* scripts/functions/eval: Test very recursive $(eval ...) calls
	with simple variable expansion (bug #2238).

	* scripts/functions/word: Test error handling for word and
	wordlist functions (bug #2407).

2003-01-22  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	#1744).

2002-10-25  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/eval: Test using $(eval ...) inside
	conditionals (Bug #1516).

2002-10-14  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	with no commands (Bug #1418).

2002-10-13  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	target-specific vars (Bug #1391).

2002-10-05  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	characters in targets and prerequisites.

2002-09-18  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/export: Test export/unexport of multiple
	variables in a single command.

2002-09-17  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/targetvars: Tests for Bug #940: test
	target-specific and pattern-specific variables in conjunction with
	double-colon targets.

2002-09-10  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* test_driver.pl (compare_output): Match the new format for time
	skew error messages.

	* scripts/features/export: Created.  Add tests for export/unexport
	capabilities, including exporting/unexporting expanded variables.

	* scripts/features/conditionals: Add a test for expanded variables
	in ifdef conditionals.

2002-09-04  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/reinvoke: Change touch/sleep combos to utouch
	invocations.
	* scripts/features/vpathgpath: Ditto.
	* scripts/features/vpathplus: Ditto.
	* scripts/options/dash-n: Ditto.
	* scripts/targets/INTERMEDIATE: Ditto.
	* scripts/targets/SECONDARY: Ditto.

	* scripts/options/dash-t: Added a test for the -t bug fixed by
	Henning Makholm.  This test was also contributed by Henning.

	* scripts/misc/general4: Add a test suite for obscure algorithmic
	features of make.  First test: make sure creation subdirectories
	as prerequisites of targets works properly.

	* scripts/misc/version: Remove this bogus test.

2002-08-07  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/misc/general3: Add a test for makefiles that don't end
	in newlines.

	* scripts/variables/special: Create tests for the special
	variables (.VARIABLES and .TARGETS).  Comment out .TARGETS test
	for now as it's not yet supported.

2002-08-01  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/options/dash-B: Add a test for the new -B option.

2002-07-11  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* run_make_tests.pl (valid_option): Add support for Valgrind.  Use
	-valgrind option to the test suite.
	(set_more_defaults): Set up the file descriptor to capture
	Valgrind output.  We have to unset its close-on-exec flag; we
	hardcode the value for F_SETFD (2) rather than load it; hopefully
	this will help us avoid breaking the Windows/DOS test suite.

2002-07-10  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/variables/automatic: Add some tests for $$@, $$(@D), and
	$$(@F).

	* test_driver.pl (utouch): Create a new function that creates a
	file with a specific timestamp offset.  Use of this function will
	let us avoid lots of annoying sleep() invocations in the tests
	just to get proper timestamping, which will make the tests run a
	lot faster.  So far it's only used in the automatic test suite.

2002-07-09  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/variables/automatic: Create a test for automatic variables.

2002-07-08  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/order_only: Test new order-only prerequisites.

2002-07-07  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/eval: Test new function.
	* scripts/functions/value: Test new function.
	* scripts/variables/MAKEFILE_LIST: Test new variable.

2002-04-28  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/call: New test: transitive closure
	implementation using $(call ...) to test variable recursion.

2002-04-21  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* test_driver.pl (compare_dir_tree): Ignore CVS and RCS
	directories in the script directories.

2001-05-02  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/variables/flavors: Test define/endef scripts where only
	one of the command lines is quiet.

2000-06-22  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/options/dash-q: New file; test the -q option.  Includes
	a test for PR/1780.

2000-06-21  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/targetvars: Added a test for PR/1709: allowing
	semicolons in target-specific variable values.

2000-06-19  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/addsuffix: Test for an empty final argument.
	Actually this bug might have happened for any function, but this
	one was handy.

2000-06-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* scripts/options/general: If parallel jobs are not supported,
	expect a warning message from Make.

2000-06-15  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* scripts/options/general: Don't try -jN with N != 1 if parallel
	jobs are not supported.

2000-05-24  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/options/general: Test general option processing (PR/1716).

2000-04-11  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/strip: Test empty value to strip (PR/1689).

2000-04-08  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* scripts/features/reinvoke: Sleep before updating the target
	files in the first test, to ensure its time stamp really gets
	newer; otherwise Make might re-exec more than once.

2000-04-07  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* scripts/features/double_colon: Don't run the parallel tests if
	parallel jobs aren't supported.

2000-04-04  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/word: wordlist doesn't swap arguments anymore.

2000-03-27  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/statipattrules: Test that static pattern rules
	whose prerequisite patterns resolve to empty strings throw an
	error (instead of dumping core).  Fixes PR/1670.

	* scripts/features/reinvoke: Make more robust by touching "b"
	first, to ensure it's not newer than "a".
	Reported by Marco Franzen <Marco.Franzen@Thyron.com>.
	* scripts/options/dash-n: Ditto.

	* scripts/functions/call: Whoops.  The fix to PR/1527 caused
	recursive invocations of $(call ...) to break.  I can't come up
	with any way to get both working at the same time, so I backed out
	the fix to 1527 and added a test case for recursive calls.  This
	also tests the fix for PR/1610.

	* scripts/features/double_colon: Test that circular dependencies
	in double-colon rule sets are detected correctly (PR/1671).

2000-03-26  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/targets/INTERMEDIATE: Test that make doesn't remove
	.INTERMEDIATE files when given on the command line (PR/1669).

2000-03-08  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/options/dash-k: Add a test for error detection by
	multiple targets depending on the same prerequisite with -k.
	For PR/1634.

2000-02-07  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/escape: Add a test for backslash-escaped spaces
	in a target name (PR/1586).

2000-02-04  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/patspecific_vars: Add a test for pattern-specific
	target variables inherited from the parent target (PR/1407).

2000-02-02  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* run_make_tests.pl (set_more_defaults): Hard-code the LANG to C
	to make sure sorting order, etc. is predictable.
	Reported by Andreas Jaeger <aj@suse.de>.

	* run_make_tests.pl (set_more_defaults): Set the $wtime variable
	depending on the OS.  Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il> reports
	this seems to need to be *4* on DOS/Windows, not just 2.  Keep it
	1 for other systems.
	* scripts/features/vpathplus (touchfiles): Use the $wtime value
	instead of hardcoding 2.
	* scripts/targets/SECONDARY: Ditto.
	* scripts/targets/INTERMEDIATE: Ditto.

2000-01-27  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* test_driver.pl (toplevel): Don't try to run test scripts which
	are really directories.

2000-01-23  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/include: Remove a check; the fix caused more
	problems than the error, so I removed it and removed the test for
	it.

2000-01-11  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/call: Add a test for PR/1517 and PR/1527: make
	sure $(call ...) doesn't eval its arguments and that you can
	invoke foreach from it without looping forever.

1999-12-15  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/targets/INTERMEDIATE: Add a test for PR/1423: make sure
	.INTERMEDIATE settings on files don't disable them as implicit
	intermediate possibilities.

1999-12-01  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/double_colon: Add a test for PR/1476: Try
	double-colon rules as non-goal targets and during parallel builds
	to make sure they're handled serially.

1999-11-17  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/functions/if: Add a test for PR/1429: put some text
	after an if-statement to make sure it works.

	* scripts/features/targetvars: Add a test for PR/1380: handling +=
	in target-specific variable definitions correctly.

1999-10-15  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/variables/MAKEFILES: This was really broken: it didn't
	test anything at all, really.  Rewrote it, plus added a test for
	PR/1394.

1999-10-13  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/options/dash-n: Add a test for PR/1379: "-n doesn't
	behave properly when used with recursive targets".

1999-10-08  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/targetvars: Add a check for PR/1378:
	"Target-specific vars don't inherit correctly"

1999-09-29  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* test_driver.pl (get_osname): Change $fancy_file_names to
	$short_filenames and reverse the logic.
	(run_each_test): Change test of non-existent $port_host to use
	$short_filenames--problem reported by Eli Zaretskii.

1999-09-23  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/parallelism: Add a check to ensure that the
	jobserver works when we re-invoke.  Also cleaned up the tests a
	little, reducing the number of rules we use so the test won't need
	as many "sleep" commands.

1999-09-16  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* scripts/features/reinvoke: Remove invocations of "touch" in
	makefiles.  See the comments on the touch function rewrite below.
	Note that UNIX touch behaves the same way if the file already
	exists: it sets the time to the _local_ time.  We don't want
	this.  This is probably a good tip for makefile writers in
	general, actually... where practical.
	* scripts/options/dash-l: Ditto.
	* scripts/options/dash-n: Ditto.

	* test_driver.pl (run_each_test): In retrospect, I don't like the
	.lN/.bN/.dN postfix required by DOS.  So, for non-DOS systems I
	changed it back to use .log, .base, and .diff.

	* run_make_tests.pl (set_more_defaults): Move the check for the
	make pathname to here from set_defaults (that's too early since it
	happens before the command line processing).
	Create a new variable $port_type, calculated from $osname, to
	specify what kind of system we're running on.  We should integrate
	the VOS stuff here, too.
	(valid_option): Comment out the workdir/-work stuff so people
	won't be fooled into thinking it works... someone needs to fix
	this, though!

	* scripts/functions/origin: Use $port_type instead of $osname.
	* scripts/functions/foreach: Ditto.
	* scripts/features/default_names: Ditto.

1999-09-15  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	* test_driver.pl (touch): Rewrite this function.  Previously it
	used to use utime() to hard-set the time based on the current
	local clock, or, if the file didn't exist, it merely created it.
	This mirrors exactly what real UNIX touch does, but it fails badly
	on networked filesystems where the FS server clock is skewed from
	the local clock: normally modifying a file causes it to get a mod
	time based on the _server's_ clock.  Hard-setting it based on the
	_local_ clock causes gratuitous errors and makes the tests
	unreliable except on local filesystems.  The new function will
	simply modify the file, allowing the filesystem to set the mod
	time as it sees fit.

	* scripts/features/parallelism: The second test output could
	change depending on how fast some scripts completed; use "sleep"
	to force the order we want.

	* test_driver.pl (toplevel): A bug in Perl 5.000 to Perl 5.004
	means that "%ENV = ();" doesn't do the right thing.  This worked
	in Perl 4 and was fixed in Perl 5.004_01, but use a loop to delete
	the environment rather than require specific versions.

	* run_make_tests.pl (set_more_defaults): Don't use Perl 5 s///
	modifier "s", so the tests will run with Perl 4.
	(set_more_defaults): Set $pure_log to empty if there's no -logfile
	option in PURIFYOPTIONS.
	(setup_for_test): Don't remove any logs unless $pure_log is set.

1999-09-15  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* scripts/features/reinvoke: Put the SHELL definition in the right
	test makefile.

1999-09-15  Paul D. Smith  <psmith@gnu.org>

	ChangeLog file for the test suite created.
