rules.  The first rule has a series of sleep and echo commands

echo statement.  When make is called in this test, it is given
the -j option with a value of 4.  This tells make that it may
start up to four jobs simultaneously.  In this case, since the
first command is a sleep command, the output of the second
and third commands will appear before the first if indeed
make is running all of these commands in parallel.";
